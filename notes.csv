"Introduction This course is broken down into six major sections, each of which corresponds to the coursebook for that day. When undertaking this course, please have in mind that we view the first two sections of material as important foundation material that students should already have some basic familiarity with. Since we recognize that different students will have different levels of competence with topics such as Python, SQL, document stores, statistics, and mathematical signals analysis, the first two books serve as a crash-course / refresher for these topics. While you will almost certainly have some level of mastery of one or more of these topics (or at least mastery that exceeds the requirements of this course), it is equally likely that one or more of these topics will not be familiar. Whatever your level of experience, we invite you to dive in and enjoy the material. It is important that you come into the class prepared to work through nearly half of the material on your own in hands-on exercises. You must also be prepared to go beyond what the labs require, experimenting with the concepts and techniques to work toward mastery and application toward your own business problems. 4",Book 1_2036060.pdf,5,"Here are the notes in advanced bullet-point format:
**Course Overview**
======================

* The course is divided into six major sections, each corresponding to a coursebook.
* The first two sections are considered foundation material, and students are expected to have some basic familiarity with the topics.

**Foundational Topics**
=====================

* **Python**
* **SQL**
* **Document stores**
* **Statistics**
* **Mathematical signals analysis**

**Course Approach**
===================

* The first two sections serve as a refresher or crash-course for the foundational topics.
* Students are expected to have varying levels of competence in these topics.
* The course is designed to accommodate different levels of experience.

**Student Expectations**
=====================

* Students are expected to work through nearly half of the material on their own through hands-on exercises.
* Students are encouraged to go beyond the lab requirements and experiment with concepts to achieve mastery and application to their own business problems."
"Even though this class is a week in length, there are limitations to what we can and cannot accom- plish. To set your expectations appropriately, let’s explain what we willdo and what we will not do this week. There is just no way we can realistically take someone from ero to a data scientist in just one week. To do so, we would have to require significant prerequisites in mathematics, statistics, and computer science. More specifically, the computer science knowledge required would be more than the general theory taught in an undergraduate program. Instead, we would have to require that you had already mastered Python, had done significant work as a DBA using SQL based databases, you had experience modern NoSQL style document stores, and that you were also competent at scraping websites… and those are just the computer science-based requirements! While significantly more mathematics would be useful as a foundation for a data scientist, there’s just no way that we can cover everything from statistics, algebra, probability theory, calculus (up to and including differential equations), and linear algebra. Just looking at that list, it’s clear that there are multiple full semesters, if not years, of college courses required. Since we know we cannot require all of the foregoing, and we humbly admit that there’s no way we can possibly teach all of that in just a few days, we have instead set our sights somewhat lower. While we will not rigorously cover statistics or mathematics, we have carefully selected key topics from these fields that you really must be familiar with. Similarly, we have selected a subset of the most useful and regularly used computer science disciplines that would be useful for a data scientist. When we turn our attention to building real machine learning networks, we again cannot possibly cover all of the incarnations of such things. Knowing this, then, we will strive to provide not rigor but important intuitions. This isn’t to say that there is no rigor at all. We strongly believe that understanding why something works is incredibly 5",Book 1_2036060.pdf,6,"Here are the notes in advanced markdown format:

**Course Expectations**
=======================

### Limitations of the Course

* The course is only one week long, and it is not possible to cover everything required to become a data scientist in such a short time.
* Significant prerequisites in mathematics, statistics, and computer science would be required to achieve this goal.

### Unachievable Requirements

* **Computer Science Requirements**:
	+ Mastery of Python
	+ Experience as a DBA using SQL-based databases
	+ Experience with modern NoSQL-style document stores
	+ Competence in web scraping
* **Mathematics Requirements**:
	+ Statistics
	+ Algebra
	+ Probability theory
	+ Calculus (up to and including differential equations)
	+ Linear algebra

### Course Objectives

* Instead of covering everything, the course will focus on key topics from statistics and mathematics that are essential for a data scientist.
* The course will also cover a subset of useful computer science disciplines for a data scientist.
* When building machine learning networks, the course will focus on providing important intuitions rather than covering all possible incarnations.

### Course Philosophy

* Understanding why something works is crucial.
* While there will not be a rigorous coverage of all topics, there will be a focus on providing a solid foundation."
"important when it comes to developing intuitions. We will, therefore, dive into some of these topics to some significant depth. However, our goal in doing so is always (and only) to allow you to understand it just well enough to be able to intuitively apply these tools and techniques to your own real-world problems. In fact, we can say that that is a major goal of the class. That is, to work to build a box of tools that you feel comfortable reaching into to acquire, explore, analyze, and extrapolate meaning from data. 6",Book 1_2036060.pdf,7,"**Course Objectives**
=====================

* The course aims to develop intuitions about various topics in the field
* The goal is to understand topics well enough to apply tools and techniques to real-world problems
* The ultimate objective is to build a **toolbox** of skills to:
	+ Acquire data
	+ Explore data
	+ Analyze data
	+ Extrapolate meaning from data"
"It’s reasonable to wonder how this class differs from courses or tutorials that you can find in other places. YouTube, for example, is chock full of machine learning demonstrations and tutorials. Sim- ilarly, with the evolution of online course delivery, there are excellent paid and free options for rigorous machine learning and artificial intelligence courses. What value does this course hold in the context of these other offerings? In our opinion, the courses, tutorials, and demonstrations that are publicly available tend to exist at the extremes of this space. These courses will either be extremely rigorous or extremely high-level. Let us explain. The rigorous classes can be quite excellent. However, they approach this problem from an academic point of view rather than a real-world application point of view. As a result, these courses rarely, if ever, concern themselves with how to apply machine learning to problems. Instead, they are focused on the mathematics required to implement a neural network, for example. Based on these founda- tions, these courses will typically assist you in building your own implementation of a machine learning library. Notice that this is a library that you could use to solve real-world problems, but since these courses almost never talk about how to acquire, preprocess, and transform your data or how to go about determining a useful network design for learning, students successfully completing these courses are often stumped as to how to proceed. At the other extreme are the tutorial or demonstration style courses or series. These can be found in places such as YouTube, Udemy, and Coursera. If you have ever watched anything about machine learning, it is likely one of these. While the demonstration will usually cover some specific machine learning problem, such as identifying handwritten digits, and the solution demonstrated works well, these tutorials never tell you how to preprocess your own data, how to obtain your own data, how to represent your data in a useful way, why the network is built as it is, what the activation functions do (or how you select them), etc. 7",Book 1_2036060.pdf,8,"Here are the notes in advanced bullet-point format:

**What Sets This Course Apart**
======================================================

* This course differs from other machine learning courses and tutorials in its approach to teaching machine learning and artificial intelligence.

**Comparison to Other Courses and Tutorials**
------------------------------------------

* Other courses and tutorials can be divided into two extremes:
	+ **Rigorous classes**: Focus on the academic and mathematical aspects of machine learning, but rarely cover how to apply machine learning to real-world problems.
		- Typically focus on building a machine learning library from scratch.
		- Lack practical guidance on acquiring, preprocessing, and transforming data, as well as determining a useful network design for learning.
	+ **Tutorial or demonstration style courses**: Focus on specific machine learning problems, but lack depth and practical guidance.
		- Typically cover only one specific problem, such as identifying handwritten digits.
		- Do not cover essential aspects, such as:
			+ **Data preprocessing**: How to preprocess and transform data.
			+ **Data acquisition**: How to obtain and represent data in a useful way.
			+ **Network design**: Why the network is built a certain way and how to select activation functions.

This course aims to provide a more comprehensive and practical approach to machine learning and artificial intelligence."
"This course is quite different. We have made an effort to position this course squarely in the center of these extremes while simultaneously attempting to provide you the tools that you need to go out and get your own data and turn that data into something that a machine learning model can process. In order to meet the lofty goals of assisting you to develop familiarity with a set of tools in your machine learning toolbox, being able to apply these tools on your own, the ability to extract and transform data in a way that machine learning can be applied, and the ability to create your own useful machine learning models, we have settled on an experiential approach. What does this mean in terms of course design? With the exception of this introduction section and the following terms and technologies introduc- tion, each “lecture” portion of the class will be covered within 30 to 60 minutes. These lectures might be lectures, some are discussions, and many include demonstrations. Following each of these sections, you will have guided hands-on activities, each of which will take another 30 to 60 minutes. The exercises are almost entirely performed using Jupyter Lab through Anaconda Navigator, which we will get you to install on your system when we get to our first exercise. We have provided you a ip file containing all of the data and notebooks used in this course. The notebooks come in pairs. The first is the guided lab notebook that you should work through, striving to complete each of the required activities. The second is an identical notebook with solutions in it. We urge you to use the first notebook and refer to the second only when you are stuck! We have also provided a single virtual machine. Some of our exercises this week make use of this VM. This is especially true for labs that require you to acquire data from some type of database or possibly from some other common information source that you might find in your own environment. We will work on getting this VM up and running during our first lab. One of the most important things to keep in mind as you work through this class is that you should work to master topics as they come. Do not be satisfied if there’s something covered in the first lab that you don’t quite understand. If we cover it in the first lab, you can be almost certain that we will rely on your mastery of that knowledge in many, if not all, of the labs that follow! Therefore, if you are stuck on something or if something isn’t clear, please ask for help! If you are taking this course at a live venue (or live online), ask your instructor or a TA to come over and help you out. Put your hand up and ask questions!

"Technologies & Terms With our introduction out of the way, it’s time for us to get started with the first introductory topic in our course. At this point in the course, we are not going to attempt to cover all of the technologies and terms deeply. Nearly everything mentioned here is covered in much greater depth later in the course. Why are we taking the time to talk about this now, then? First, to provide you with an overall view of where we are going in this course. Second, to provide a common framework of terms that we will rely on for the rest of the class. There are certainly more terms that we will learn as we go. This base set of terms connected with some fundamental skills with the technologies we will use to learn about machine learning should make the first two days a bit easier to digest. 9",Book 1_2036060.pdf,10,"### Course Overview

"Tools Overview Jupyter Notebook has become one of the most commonly used tools for interactive Python develop- ment that allows for easy experimentation, simple inline documentation, inline visualization, and code organization. While the tool is perhaps best known for its use with Python for machine learning and data science tasks, it supports many more languages. The supported languages include R, SQL, Mongo (as far as it can be viewed as a language), C, Ruby, and many more. The support for these is through modules termed kernels . Since Jupyter supports all of the languages and technologies that we make use of in this course, it provides a natural and obvious choice for our labs. Another huge bonus is the ability to create inline documentation via Markdown. This allows us to build what amounts to an interactive workbook. The particular version of Jupyter that we will be using is Jupyter Lab, which is the most recent in- carnation. We will walk through installing the Anaconda Dashboard during our first lab. Anaconda will make working with Jupyter very simple. This choice is also motivated by the desire to create an experience that you can replicate in your office and which mirrors what many data scientists use every day. We will be using Anaconda as an easy way to get Jupyter, Python, and some other required libraries installed on your system, which will allow you to translate this directly to your work environment. For example, while we do not use Anaconda within our office as the basis for our research server, we do use Jupyter Lab. Jupyter Lab allows us to have a shared workspace with shared notebooks while also allowing us to have some basic security. Why not just use Jupyter on individual workstations? There are a few main reasons. The first reason is a concern about continuity. We do not back up workstations, period. By providing 10",Book 1_2036060.pdf,11,"Here are the notes on Jupyter Notebook in advanced bullet-point markdown format:

### Benefits of Jupyter Lab over Individual Workstations
=====================================================

* **Continuity**: ensures continuous work without worrying about workstation backup
* **Other reasons**: to be discussed in the lab"
"a centralized Jupyter Lab server, we can create a server with plenty of redundant storage that is backed up frequently. The second reason is far more compelling. Rather than investing thousands of dollars per worksta- tion for additional RAM, high-end GPUs, storage, etc., we can put all of that money into a single system that has 512 gigs of RAM, 16 terabytes of storage, and as many GPUs as the PCI-e channels can handle. While this single system is pricey, we end up utilizing the hardware far more exten- sively than we would 15 high-end workstations, most of which would sit idle unless the user was actively working on a data science task. Note that we do not use Anaconda on that server. It’s not Anaconda that makes this all work. We have simply installed all of the necessary tools and supporting libraries, including Jupyter. Ana- conda just makes that installation easy, especially since we’re trying to support whatever kind of computer a student happens to show up to class with! 11",Book 1_2036060.pdf,12,"**Centralized Jupyter Lab Server**
=============================

**Advantages**
-------------

* **Cost-effective**: Instead of investing thousands of dollars per workstation for additional RAM, high-end GPUs, storage, etc.
* **Hardware utilization**: Single system with 512GB RAM, 16TB storage, and multiple GPUs, leading to more extensive hardware utilization compared to 15 high-end workstations that often sit idle.

**Server Configuration**
---------------------

* **Installed tools and libraries**: Necessary tools and supporting libraries, including Jupyter, installed on the server.
* **No Anaconda**: Anaconda not used on the server; instead, individual tools and libraries are installed for ease of use.

**Benefits**
------------

* **Easy support**: Easy to support students with various computers, thanks to the flexibility of the centralized server."
"The primary language that we will use for our activities in this class is Python. There are other languages frequently used in data science. R is one of the most popular, Julia is another common option, and Go (or Golang) has some data science adherents as well. Why have we chosen Python over the other options? This is a fair question, especially since R and Julia are domain-specific languages designed for data analytics and statistics. The answer to that question, however, actually lies in that last sentence. R and Julia are domain-specific languages. A domain-specific language is a language created for one very specific task or set of tasks. This tends to mean that the language is highly optimized for those tasks and should allow you to solve problems in that domain space intuitively using the language. The downside of this is that these languages are difficult to use to do anything else. If you already use one of these languages, don’t take this the wrong way. We’re not implying that there’s anything wrong with these languages, nor are we challenging you to solve general-purpose computing problems with them. By comparison, however, for people who work in the information security or information technology spaces, Python makes much more sense. Another big downside to R and Julia is that they do not lend themselves to building finished solutions. For example, if we spent a few weeks exploring, transforming, and experimenting with our data in R and then wanted to integrate that into some production system, we would need to reproduce all of that work in some other language to easily connect it to our web service, for example. Python, on the other hand, has had rapidly growing support for statistics and analysis libraries. While the support is not yet as robust as it is for a language like R, we have the added advantage of Python being familiar. There’s a reasonable chance that you have used Python and will continue to use Python for many other tasks in your environment. Finally, Python is easily integrated into almost any process that you have since it isa general-purpose language. 12",Book 1_2036060.pdf,13,"Here are the notes on the provided passage:

**Why Python for Data Science?**
=================================

**Other Options in Data Science**
--------------------------------

* R: a popular domain-specific language for data analytics and statistics
* Julia: a common option for data science tasks
* Go (or Golang): has some adherents in data science

**Domain-Specific Languages**
-----------------------------

* Created for a very specific task or set of tasks
* Highly optimized for those tasks
* Difficult to use for other tasks outside of their domain space

**Python Advantages**
----------------------

* **General-purpose language**: easily integrated into various tasks and processes
* Familiarity: likely already used and will continue to use Python in other tasks
* Growing support for **statistics and analysis libraries**
* Can be used to build **finished solutions** and integrate with other systems (e.g., web services)

**Comparison to R and Julia**
-----------------------------

* R and Julia are domain-specific languages, making them less versatile than Python
* Difficult to use R and Julia for tasks outside of their domain space
* Reproducing work in R or Julia to integrate with other systems can be challenging"
"When it comes to putting our machine learning theory into practice, we will use TensorFlow through- out this class. We recognize that there are many researchers who have strong loyalties and prefer- ences for PyTorch. Our decision, however, is not arbitrary. PyTorch is a free open-source machine learning library. It is a Python-based implementation of Torch, which is a Lua wrapper around a compiled C machine learning library. PyTorch is actively supported by Facebook through the Facebook AI Research lab (FAIR). It will most frequently be found within academic courses that feature or develop machine learning solutions. You may also find it in a lesser proportion of commercial applications. A nice bonus to PyTorch is that AWS has built-in support for it, but PyTorch can be very challenging to use with other languages. In fact, to do so, you almost always write a Python wrapper that is called by your other language. TensorFlow, on the other hand, is a free open-source product from Google. Whereas PyTorch is found in a small proportion of commercial machine learning solutions, TensorFlow is very widely used. TensorFlow has the added advantage of being a library that you can use from Python or with which you can directly interface using several mobile development platforms and languages like Swift and C++, all without a Python wrapper. 13",Book 1_2036060.pdf,14,"Here are the notes on TensorFlow and PyTorch:

"Another library that we will make heavy use of is NumPy. NumPy arrays are relied on heavily by TensorFlow (and PyTorch). This proves to be fortuitous since we will begin using NumPy in the labs for books one and two since it provides excellent statistics and analysis functions. If you have used Python somewhat extensively already but have not used NumPy, you might wonder why it’s needed. After all, can’t we just implement whatever functions NumPy has directly in Python? While we could do this, there are two reasons why we shouldn’t. First, we should reuse well-written code, and NumPy definitely falls into this category. Second, NumPy is actually a set of compiled binary libraries with exposed Python interfaces. This means that NumPy will perform orders of magnitude more quickly than native Python code that implements the same functionality. We will begin to explore NumPy later in this book. Especially if you are already a Python user, be prepared for it to be very familiar yet different. Personally, you might relate it to the difference between Dutch and German. If you speak either language and hear the other, it sounds very familiar, and you feel as though you should understand what’s being said, but things are just different enough that you need some translation. 14",Book 1_2036060.pdf,15,"Here are the notes on NumPy in advanced bullet-point markdown format:

**NumPy**
==========

* **Importance**: Heavily relied on by TensorFlow and PyTorch
* **Functions**: Excellent statistics and analysis functions
* **Why use NumPy?**

	+ **Performance**: Orders of magnitude faster than native Python code due to being compiled binary libraries with exposed Python interfaces
* **Comparison to Python**: Familiar yet different, similar to the difference between Dutch and German languages
* **Upcoming Exploration**: Will be explored later in the book"
"There is another library that we will use that has graphing capabilities, but it is not primarily the graphing capabilities that make it attractive for our use: Pandas. Pandas is a data analysis library. It is implemented as an extension of two-dimensional NumPy arrays. The beauty and utility of Pandas will become apparent as we start to work with our Jupyter Note- books. As powerful as NumPy is, it can be somewhat cumbersome when it comes to examining the raw data. For example, a NumPy\index{Python!NumPy array can easily handle ten thousand or a million elements… but if we try to look at all of those elements, there are a few problems. First, trying to print all of those values into a Jupyter cell will be very time-consuming. Second, the data is just sort of plopped out into the cell. It doesn’t look very good, and it’s not very friendly to work with. Pandas, on the other hand, will allow us to represent our data in a DataFrame. The DataFrame class will allow us to look at our data in a much more appealing and easy-to-read format, in addition to being much friendlier with Jupyter rendering. The value of Pandas doesn’t end here, though. It also has some super nice and easy-to-use features for visualizing correlations and other analysis of our data rapidly. While we will introduce and use some of the features in Pandas, be clear that we will prefer to use NumPy in this course. This is a considered and intentional choice. While Pandas is a wonderful tool for rapid data manipulation, it is limited to handling two dimensional data, or ℝ2data. A number of projects that we work with will have deeper dimensional spaces, making Pandas a very challenging choice. Rather than focus on Pandas and then be required to learn the intricacies of NumPy as well, we will focus on NumPy and use Pandas for some convenience in some of our problems. 15",Book 1_2036060.pdf,16,"Here are the notes on Pandas and its relationship with NumPy in advanced bullet-point markdown format:

"It will frequently be very useful for us to be able to visualize our data in some way. This is something that we often experiment with when exploring data, seeking to get a feel for what the data contains and, perhaps, relationships or patterns within the data. It is not unusual to want to create some visual representation of the data or of our analysis of that data as an end product. For example, we could create a numeric representation of the average network load in our enterprise, but a visual representation of that same data might be much more intuitive for the consumers of that report. The majority of our visualization needs will be met through the use of Matplotlib. This open-source visualization library has nearly any feature or type of graph that you might want to create. Unfor- tunately, using this library is not always especially intuitive. To help with this, we have several introductory exercises in connection with this book to get you started with some common patterns. We will leverage this knowledge in the coming sections of the course as we explore, analyze, and visualize our data. While we could create finished visualizations that will be consumed by end-users of our solutions using Matplotlib, it isn’t always the best choice. To make our lives just a bit easier, we will have a look at Dash. Dash makes use of an alternative graphing library from Plotly. It is specifically tar- geted at creating web-based dashboards simply. Conveniently, there is also a Dash kernel available for Jupyter (JupyterDash). 16",Book 1_2036060.pdf,17,"Here are the notes on data visualization using Matplotlib and Dash:

"A critical ability of a data scientist is not only the ability to transform data but to acquire data from various sources. This will require, maybe not mastery, but indeed some facility with the languages and tools used to access data. Traditionally, much of our data is stored in SQL databases. These relational databases are very powerful tools for organizing and retrieving our data. They strike a balance between efficient stor- age of the data, attempting to minimize duplication within the data, and speed of access through well-thought-out indexing and queries. While we will cover ANSI SQL generally, the SQL server that we have available on the course VM is PostgreSQL. You will find that every SQL server has its own quirks and extra features that are unique to that specific server. While the query language that we will work with is standard, looking at the documentation for the specific SQL server that you have can be very valuable when you are trying to do anything more than simple queries. 17",Book 1_2036060.pdf,18,"Here are the notes in advanced bullet-point markdown format:

"An alternative to the SQL paradigm is a document store. These come in a variety of forms that we can put into just two main categories. We are not saying that there are no other ways to store data, however! For example, even though ISAM (Indexed Sequential Access Method), VSAM (Virtual Storage Access Method), and others are still alive and well, they are not commonly exposed directly for queries. Document stores are typically either as a general document store or as a key-value store. In a sense, all document stores are a form of a key-value store. A key-value store supports high-speed retrieval of records through a key. You can think of this key as representing what we might think of as the ID column in a SQL database. With a key-value store, however, you may never use any part of the value in your search or query. In other words, we say that the value is opaque . Conversely, a general document store will also have at least one key field (though we can create indexes based on other fields if we choose), and we can also specify values within the documents that we wish to include as a part of our search criteria. Why would these be used over a SQL store? Key-value stores are very fast, though the limitation of only searching based on the key can be limiting in many applications. Document stores are also fast, but the real benefit is that a single relatively fast query will return the entire document with all related data since it is all stored as a single document. A SQL database can be fast, but the real benefits come from the deduplication of data, which saves space and also makes updating relatively easy. 18",Book 1_2036060.pdf,19,"Here are the notes on document stores as an alternative to the SQL paradigm:

**Document Stores**
=====================

**Types of Document Stores**
---------------------------

* **General Document Store**: allows searching within the document values
* **Key-Value Store**: supports high-speed retrieval of records through a key; value is **opaque** (not searchable)

**Key Features**
---------------

* **Key-Value Store**:
	+ Fast retrieval through a key (like an ID column in a SQL database)
	+ Limited searching capabilities (only by key)
* **General Document Store**:
	+ Fast retrieval of entire document with related data
	+ Supports indexing on multiple fields
	+ Can specify values within the document for search criteria

**Comparison to SQL Stores**
---------------------------

* **Speed**: Key-Value Stores and Document Stores are fast, but with limitations
* **Deduplication of Data**: SQL databases save space and make updating easier

"Other Data Science Terms Another technology that you will run into in the data science and analytics space is Big Data. This is a somewhat nebulous term that takes in many technologies, including IBM’s partnership with Cloudera for large-scale cloud-based mass storage, Apache Spark, which provides a solution for on-premises large-scale data storage, and others. These technologies are generally split into two main sets of features. One is the storage mechanism, whether it is using a widely distributed filesystem or some other approach. The other is the interface or language that you use to interact with the data in the data lake. These tools typically have machine learning features built-in, but in our experience, many organi- ations are not fully leveraging these capabilities. More commonly, we see them using the ETL capabilities. ETL stands for Extract, Transform, and Load. For example, one customer uses a Spark job to export all data relating to all building projects worldwide from all of the various SQL servers and database instances in all of their data centers every night. This data is exported into a Spark Hadoop backed filesystem. Once this is done, they run a series of transformations against this data, reprocessing it to generate useful analytics. Once this is completed, the resulting data is loaded into another SQL database server from which the analytics data is then made available through Microsoft Power BI. We will not be covering any of these solutions or tools in our course. Everything that we cover can be translated directly into an environment using these tools. In a very real sense, the work that we are doing in this course is the precursor to being able to leverage these tools well. Another technology that we will touch on but not use extensively is that of MapReduce. Still, we felt that it would be important for you to be familiar with the term since it comes up frequently, 19",Book 1_2036060.pdf,20,"Here are the notes on the provided passage in advanced markdown format:

"especially when dealing with very large data sets. MapReduce is a generalized approach where we take a transformation that we would like to perform on a very large data set and break it down into a number of tasks that can all be run in parallel. The “Map” phase involves iterating over all of the data, performing the initial transformation or aggregation. The reduce phase takes all of the results from the map phase and aggregates them down to either a single value or a single data vector. A simple to grasp example would be determining the word count for every individual word in the 60,000+ books stored in Project Gutenberg. While the task itself is not difficult, this will require time to complete if we process each book sequentially. How could we improve this? What if we create a map layer with 1,000 nodes in it. Each node is assigned 60 books to download and count words in. All 1,000 nodes can work in parallel. Once these nodes complete, we could push their individual counts through a “Reduce” layer. If we pushed them all to one node, that would create another bottleneck, so we instead put them through a set of nodes, which then proceeds to reduce further to another layer, and perhaps another, finally producing a single result. 20",Book 1_2036060.pdf,21,"Here are the notes on MapReduce in advanced bullet-point markdown format:

**MapReduce: A Parallel Processing Approach**
=====================================================

**Key Concepts:**

* **Map Phase**: Initial transformation or aggregation of a large data set
* **Reduce Phase**: Aggregation of results from the Map phase to a single value or data vector

**How MapReduce Works:**
-----------------------------

* **Map Phase**:
	+ Iterate over the entire data set
	+ Perform initial transformation or aggregation
* **Reduce Phase**:
	+ Take results from the Map phase
	+ Aggregate results to a single value or data vector

**Example: Word Count in Project Gutenberg**
---------------------------------------------

* **Problem**: Counting words in 60,000+ books
* **Sequential Processing**: Time-consuming, inefficient
* **MapReduce Solution**:
	+ Create a map layer with 1,000 nodes
	+ Assign 60 books to each node for word counting
	+ Process in parallel
	+ Results from each node sent to a **Reduce Layer**
	+ **Reduce Layer**: Aggregates results from each node
	+ Multiple reduce layers can be used to further aggregate results

**Benefits of MapReduce:**

* **Parallel Processing**: Speeds up processing time
* **Scalability**: Handles large data sets efficiently"
"Chances are that, like most people, you come to data science with some preconceptions when it comes to some of the words that are used in this space. Take, for example, data. In the context of data science, data is just some fact or group of facts with no specific structure or context. This can seem very Zen and a bit counterintuitive. After all, we are humans, and we are constantly processing facts to arrive at conclusions. We just do this naturally. Sometimes, though, it does lead to incorrect conclusions. We will view data as facts. Data has no meaning on its own. It must be interpreted in some way. 21",Book 1_2036060.pdf,22,"Here are the notes on the topic of data in the context of data science:

**Data Science**
===============

**Key Concept:** **Data**
------------------------

### Definition of Data

* **Data**: A fact or group of facts with no specific structure or context.
* **Important**: Data has no meaning on its own and must be interpreted in some way.

### Human Intuition vs. Data Interpretation

* Humans naturally process facts to arrive at conclusions.
* However, this can sometimes lead to **incorrect conclusions**.

Let me know if you'd like me to help with anything else!"
"When we take a collection of facts, transform them (perhaps) in some way, and aggregate them, these facts can be interpreted or structured to produce information. Information has meaning and assists us in making decisions. Using the example that began on the previous slide, imagine that we move our foot and feel it touching something. Perhaps you can relate to this more with the idea of your hand or fingers touching something unexpected. We can react without a great deal of thought, immediately jumping to a conclusion without doing a lot of processing. For example, if we feel something round and long under our foot that seems to move, we might immediately react with the thought, “Snake!” But is it a snake? More facts would be required. If the only facts we have are long, round, and moving, we might also be stepping on a branch or the tail of our cat! It’s only after we analyze as many facts as possible that we can make an accurate assessment. Admittedly, when your hand touches something unexpected or limited data makes your brain think, “Snake!” you are probably happy to seem a little bit foolish in the case of “not snake”. Imagine how relieved you would be if you discovered that it wasa snake! A well-known illustration, based on a poem by John Godfrey Saxe named Blind Men and the Ele- phant1, is useful for thinking about the definition of information that we are discussing. While the poem is really about the opinions that scholars and others form on topics about which they know next to nothing, the idea still works well here: It was six men of Indostan To learning much inclined, Who went to see the Elephant 1https://allpoetry.com/The-Blind-Man-And-The-Elephant 22",Book 1_2036060.pdf,23,"Here are the notes in advanced bullet-point markdown format:

**Information and Decision Making**
=================================================

* **Information**: a collection of transformed and aggregated facts that provide meaning and assist in decision making
* **Example**: feeling something round and long underfoot, which may lead to a immediate conclusion (e.g., ""Snake!"")
* **Insufficient facts**: relying solely on limited data can lead to incorrect assumptions (e.g., jumping to conclusions without analyzing all available facts)

* **Facts**: individual pieces of data or observations
* **Information**: structured and aggregated facts that provide meaning
* **Decision making**: the process of making informed choices based on available information"

"And so these men of Indostan Disputed loud and long, Each in his own opinion Exceeding stiff and strong, Though each was partly in the right, And all were in the wrong! So, oft in theologic wars The disputants, I ween, Rail on in utter ignorance Of what each other mean, And prate about an Elephant Not one of them has seen! While this is a commentary on opinions and bias, the idea is useful. Information, for us, is created by aggregating many data points. Each of those data point represents some fact which, on its own, means very little. In aggregate, however, we can create structured information that leads to deeper insights. 24",Book 1_2036060.pdf,25,"**The Blind Men and the Elephant**
==============================

### Commentary on Opinions and Bias

* The poem describes a group of men from Indostan disputing over an elephant, each with their own strong opinion, but all are partly right and wrong.
* The poem is a commentary on how people can be **biased** and **ignorant** of others' perspectives, leading to **misunderstandings**.

### Information Creation

* **Information** is created by aggregating many **data points**, each representing a single fact that means little on its own.
* **Aggregating data points** leads to **structured information**, which in turn leads to **deeper insights**.

Note: The poem ""The Blind Men and the Elephant"" is used as a metaphor to illustrate the importance of considering multiple perspectives and aggregating data points to gain a deeper understanding of a subject."
"When trying to quickly decide if something is a snake, we can rely on other cues. For instance, a quick glance downward will probably tell us quickly what we are stepping on. In a sense, we would like to do the same thing with data in our enterprise. The challenge is that it can be difficult to give our data a “quick glance.” This could be because of the volume of data that we have, or the way the data is structured, or the fact that it lacks structure and is, perhaps, scattered around in multiple locations. How can we take non-intuitive and perhaps unrelated facts and assemble them into information? Sometimes data can be aggregated and transformed very easily. For example, ascertaining that the temperature of the hard drives in our storage arrays are at a safe level is easily done, provided we have proper instrumentation in our servers. No deep analysis is needed. But what if we wanted to predict whether a particular drive is likely to fail in the next 72 hours? One of the strongest sets of tools that we have is the field of statistics. We can break statistics down into two general categories of tasks. Statistics is either descriptive orpredictive . Descriptive statistics is about aggregating and transforming our data to produce new and interest- ing facts about our data as a whole or using these descriptive techniques to allow us to compare subsets of our data to the whole in a meaningful way. Predictive or inferential statistics allow us to make predictions about other data that we haven’t yet looked at or predict events that have not yet happened, based on the data that we have considered already. A related field of mathematics is probability theory. In fact, aspects of statistics rely heavily on probability. This field can be very useful for us in determining possible outcomes and likelihoods. It can also be very useful for classifying data (the act of classifying data produces new information) and possibly identifying anomalies. Another set of tools that we have to transform our data are those provided by machine learning. No 25",Book 1_2036060.pdf,26,"Here are the notes in advanced bullet-point format:

"doubt, these are the tools that you are most interested in if you are taking this course. We will dig into these beginning in book 3. A well-known mathematician, Hannah Fry, made the observation that machine learning, at least as it is accomplished today, is possibly best described as a “…revolution in computational statistics…” We agree strongly with this observation. Indeed, this fact is the reason that we spend the entire second book using statistics and other mathematics tools to manipulate our data before we ever look at what most would consider to be machine learning. Machine learning today can be broken down into two approaches, supervised learning andunsupervised learning Supervised learning is used for classification and prediction. This approach is distinguished by the fact that the training process involves providing the algorithm with both sample data and expected outcomes . In fact, the primary distinction between supervised learning and unsupervised learning is that, in unsupervised learning, we provide only data to the algorithm, no sample outcomes. This leads to unsupervised learning solutions being used primarily for anomaly detection and clustering problems. 26",Book 1_2036060.pdf,27,"Here are the notes on Machine Learning in advanced markdown format:

"The approaches and techniques that we used to acquire raw data and transform and assemble it into useful information is the field of data science. This is true whether the transformation that we are performing is as simple as a statistical average or as complex as a many-layered convolutional neural network. The tools used vary, but the goal is the same; transform data into useful information that we can then use to make decisions. We can break this down into a series of repeated steps that we will seek to master throughout this course: •Acquire data - Identifying and accessing data sources that already exist or possibly generating meaningful data. •Preprocess data - Data, especially data that we acquire from some system or collection within the enterprise, is rarely in a form that lends itself to the analysis that we would like to perform. We must first preprocess the data, transforming it to a useful form and perhaps cleaning the data, removing outliers, filling in gaps, or otherwise converting the data to some standard. •Organize the data - A hidden step in this process is data exploration. Remember that data, on its own, is just a collection of facts. We will need to spend time between the previous step and this step exploring the data to find interesting ways that the data can be organized that results in what appears to be meaningful information. •Generate results - After the previous steps are complete, we can perform one final set of transformations, generating descriptions or inferences based on our data. These can then be presented to stakeholders for decisions. Taken together, we can say that the purpose of these steps is ultimately to allow us to extract insights from our data. 27",Book 1_2036060.pdf,28,"Here are the notes on the topic of data science:

"It is generally agreed that the field of data science emerges from the intersection of other fields. All data scientists should have a background in mathematics and computer science, in addition to some other specific knowledge domain. In a sense, we can view both statistics and computer science as sub-fields of mathematics. Even so, most would admit that we cannot expect a pure mathematician to write SQL code to interact with a database! Still, a mathematics background will be very helpful working in the field of data science. At a minimum, we must have some knowledge of statistics and how they are applied. However, having at least a passing familiarity with calculus and linear algebra will help us to more easily understand why or how statistics and other data science tools work. From the field of computer science, we need to have some level of competency in programming. At a minimum, we must be able to interact with our data storage systems and be able to successfully extract data from them. We must also be able to organize and process that data programmatically, so competency in at least one programming language is a necessity. While there are what amount to “point and click” machine learning tools available commercially, if we are seeking to build some- thing more complex or to apply these tools in more interesting ways, we must have competency in a language that interfaces directly with the API of the machine learning frameworks available.

"Lists and Dictionaries Jumping right in, let’s start with lists. As you no doubt know, within Python, everything is an object. Objects are instances of classes, which are generalized definitions of some abstract data type and the associated methods and attributes of that type. Lists are no different. Lists and the closely related array type within Python are a mutable list of ordered values. In some other languages, you may find these using the underlying math term, “Vector.” Lists and arrays within Python, like most languages, are ero-indexed. They are also iterables within Python. This means that we can iterate, or sequentially traverse, the members of the array. There are other deeper meanings when it comes to iterables in Python, but they aren’t important for us in the context of an array. Python arrays restrict you to using a single type for all elements. In many cases, this doesn’t seem restrictive, but when we are importing data from a variety of sources, this can represent a challenge. The native list type does not have this same restriction. An alternative way of storing data is using a key-value store known as a dictionary. Dictionaries al- low us to use arbitrary keys as indices and assign any value to each. Dictionaries have no restrictions on the mixing of types in both keys and values. 32",Book 1_2036060.pdf,33,"Here are the notes in advanced bullet-point format:

**Lists and Dictionaries in Python**
=====================================

**Lists**
--------

* **Mutable** list of ordered values
* Ero-indexed ( indexing starts at 0 )
* **Iterables**: can be sequentially traversed
* Can store different data types
* **No type restriction**: elements can be of different types
* Similar to arrays in other languages, but more flexible
* Example: `[1, ""a"", 3.5, ...]`

**Dictionaries**
--------------

* **Key-value store**
* Use **arbitrary keys** as indices
* Assign any value to each key
* **No type restrictions**: keys and values can be of different types
* Example: `{""name"": ""John"", ""age"": 30, ...}`

Note: The native list type in Python is more flexible than arrays, which restrict elements to a single type. Dictionaries offer a more dynamic way of storing data with arbitrary keys and values."
"When we have a collection of objects, whether they are in an array or a dictionary, one of the most common activities is to traverse all of the nodes in that collection. In the code example above, you can see that the variable a_list has been assigned an array of values. The type, that is, an array of integers, is inferred by the assignment. If you are somewhat less fluent in Python, it is important to know that the square brackets used are specific to arrays or lists. If we were to instead use parentheses, a_list = (1,2,3,4,5) , we would be assigning a five-term immutable tuple to a_list , which is entirely different. Curly braces, similarly, have another meaning, which we will cover shortly. When working with an iterable class in Python, we can use the structure for item in col- lection: to iterate sequentially over the values. This is true whether the iterable is an in-memory structure such as an array or some other structure like a cursor returned by a database library class. Of course, it is possible to use an approach that is common in most languages: for i in range(0,len(collection)): print(collection[i]) While this works as expected, this would not be considered to be a “Pythonic” approach. Pythonic means that the code is not only syntactically correct and produces the expected output, but that it also follows the conventions of the Python community and best fits the intentions of how the language is meant to be used. For our class, we aren’t particularly concerned about being Pythonic, but we will still try to write acceptably Pythonic code when we can. While either of the approaches above works just fine, they are not the most efficient ways to process an array. We will consider these to be straightforward but naive approaches. This is not to say that these are “bad” ways to approach a problem, but they might not be the most efficient. 33",Book 1_2036060.pdf,34,"Here are the notes in advanced bullet-point markdown format:
**Traversing a Collection in Python**
=================================================

### Iterating over a Collection
* Use the `for` loop to iterate sequentially over the values in a collection: `for item in collection:`
* Works with any iterable class, including arrays and cursors returned by a database library class
* Example: `a_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]; for item in a_list: print(item)`

### Important Syntax Notes
* **Arrays (Lists)**: Use square brackets `[]` to define an array
* **Immutable Tuples**: Use parentheses `()` to define a tuple
* **Curly Braces**: Have another meaning, which will be covered later

### Non-Pythonic Approach
* Using `range()` and indexing: `for i in range(0, len(collection)): print(collection[i])`
* Works, but not considered ""Pythonic"" (doesn't follow Python community conventions and language intentions)

### Efficient Processing
* The above approaches are straightforward but naive and not the most efficient ways to process an array
* We will consider more efficient ways to process arrays later"
"Before worrying about efficiency, we’d like to point out a very useful approach when traversing an array. At times, we might be tempted to use the for i in range(0,len(collection)): construction because we need not only the element in the array, but we also need its index for our algorithm. Even so, writing it in this way is not Pythonic. Again, while we are not fixated on being Pythonic, there is a very useful construct that we can use in Python that simplifies our code somewhat: for index, item in enumerate(collection): print(f""{index} : {item}) Notice that we are using the enumerate() function. This function returns a tuple with the index of the current item and the item found at that index all in one step. Ultimately, it is up to you to write code that you understand and that performs the tasks that you need to be accomplished. However, you may find this construct very handy. This can be used with any iterable class. Note, though, that this is no more efficient than the previous examples. 34",Book 1_2036060.pdf,35,"Here are the notes in advanced bullet-point markdown format:

**Traversing an Array in Python**
====================================

* **Non-Pythonic Way**: Using `for i in range(0, len(collection))` is not the best approach.
* **Pythonic Way**: Use `enumerate()` function to traverse an array.

**`enumerate()` Function**
-------------------------

* Returns a tuple containing:
	+ **Index** of the current item
	+ **Item** found at that index
* Example: `for index, item in enumerate(collection): print(f""{index} : {item}"")`

**Advantages**
--------------

* Simplifies code
* Can be used with any **iterable class**
* Handy construct for traversing arrays

**Note**
------

* This approach is not more efficient than the previous examples.
* Write code that you understand and performs the tasks needed."
"If you are interested in speed, there is definitely a better approach. Before going further, though, we need to bear in mind that while speed is good, readability is also important. This is especially true if we want to be able to reuse our code easily. That said, the most efficient way to traverse a list or array is with a list comprehension . While there is a separate map() function that takes a function and an iterable as arguments, a list comprehension is effectively a mapping operation. This technique is both powerful and tricky. A list comprehension allows us to apply an operation to every element in the list, returning the modified list as its return value. This doesn’t mean that you must capture the returned value; for example, your comprehension might simply be used to print out each value. If you captured the output of the comprehension you would have a list of the return values from each of the calls to the print() function, which might not be particularly useful. On the other hand, what if our array contains a list of command strings that we want to execute using the oslibrary? We could use a comprehension to execute each string as a command and capture the return values, which would be useful. While all of the above is possible, the most compelling reason to use a list comprehension is ef- ficiency. You will find that the larger the number of elements in your list, the more positively a list comprehension compares with a for loop structure. The only tricky part can be figuring out exactly how to write the transformation that you want to apply to each list element. 35",Book 1_2036060.pdf,36,"Here are the notes in advanced bullet-point markdown format:

**Efficient List Traversal: List Comprehensions**
=====================================================

**Motivation**
-------------

* Speed and readability are important considerations when working with lists or arrays
* List comprehensions offer a efficient way to traverse and transform lists

**List Comprehensions**
---------------------

* **Definition**: A list comprehension is a powerful and concise way to apply an operation to every element in a list
* **Similarity to `map()` function**: A list comprehension is effectively a mapping operation
* **Return value**: A modified list is returned as the result of the comprehension
* **Optional capturing of return value**: The returned list can be captured or ignored, depending on the use case

**Use Cases**
-------------

* **Example 1: Printing values**: A list comprehension can be used to print out each value in a list
* **Example 2: Executing command strings**: A list comprehension can be used to execute each command string in a list and capture the return values

**Advantages**
-------------

* **Efficiency**: List comprehensions are more efficient than `for` loop structures, especially for large lists
* **Concise code**: List comprehensions provide a concise way to perform list transformations

**Challenges**
-------------

* **Figuring out the transformation**: The tricky part of using list comprehensions is determining the transformation to apply to each list element"
"There is a far more computationally efficient mechanism that Python provides, though it can be a bit difficult to parse when abused. The more efficient approach is the use of a list comprehension . You may at first assume that a list comprehension is just a special shorthand that is effectively pro- ducing the same code as a for loop. This is nottrue. In fact, a list comprehension will typically outperform the corresponding for loop for arrays of any significant size. Internally, a comprehen- sion is a highly optimized operation. For a simple comprehension these are very straightforward to create and work with. Imagine our for loop looked like this: a_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] for index, item in enumerate(a_list): a_list[i] = item * 5 This will loop through our list, replacing each item with five times its value. Written as a list comprehension, we might use: a_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] a_list = [i * 5 for i in a_list] This is definitely more Pythonic. For a simple operation like this, it is also very straightforward to implement and to read. Where we can get into trouble is when we start nesting these comprehen- sions. We will look at an example soon. Notice, too, that an alternative mechanism to accomplish this same task would be to use the map() function. This built-in function allows us to pass in a function to be called with each element of an array as an argument. The function will automatically replace each element at each index with the result from the function called as the first argument to map() . 36",Book 1_2036060.pdf,37,"Here are the notes in advanced bullet-point format:

**List Comprehensions**
=====================

**Efficient Mechanism**
---------------------

* More computationally efficient than using a `for` loop
* Internally, a comprehension is a highly optimized operation

**Basic List Comprehension**
-------------------------

* Example: `a_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]; a_list = [i * 5 for i in a_list]`
* Replaces each item in the list with five times its value
* More Pythonic and straightforward to implement and read

**Alternative Mechanism: `map()` Function**
-----------------------------------------

* Allows us to pass in a function to be called with each element of an array as an argument
* Automatically replaces each element at each index with the result from the function called as the first argument to `map()`

**Potential Issues**
-------------------

* Nesting list comprehensions can lead to complexity and difficulty in parsing"
"If list comprehensions do what map() does, why do both exist? A simple answer is that arrays are typically held completely in memory. In fact, executing a list comprehension will operate on that entire data set in memory. What if that data set has 10,000,000,000,000 elements? Even at one byte each, this will require many terabytes of RAM! Themap() alternative can be used with any iterable . An iterable is an abstraction to a collection of data that allows us to access each element sequentially. An iterable, however, is not necessarily an array. In fact, an iterable need not be in memory. The iterable could be an object that allows us to iteratively access elements from a very large result set from a database query. (In this case, you will often run into the idea of a cursor in the database library documentation.) The iterable might also be another interesting Python feature, a generator . We will discuss generators much later in our course since they can be very useful when creating training data sets. For now, suffice to say that a generator is called iteratively, returning subsequent values in response to each call. 37",Book 1_2036060.pdf,38,"Here are the notes on the topic:

**List Comprehensions vs `map()`**
======================================================

**Why both exist?**
-----------------------

* List comprehensions operate on entire data sets in memory, which can be a limitation with large data sets.
* `map()` alternative can be used with any **iterable**.

**Iterables**
-------------

* An abstraction to a collection of data that allows sequential access to each element.
* Not necessarily an array; doesn't require all data to be in memory.
* Examples:
	+ Object allowing iterative access to elements from a large database query result set (e.g., using a **cursor**).
	+ **Generator**: returns subsequent values on each call, useful for creating training data sets.

Note: Generators will be discussed later in the course."
"Dictionaries, which we defined as key-value stores, also support comprehensions. Dictionary com- prehensions can be useful, especially when exploring and building data transformations. This is especially true of data records from databases. These are typically exposed to use as rows of data that we must then extract or parse values out of. The structure of a dictionary comprehension is essentially the same as that of a list comprehension. The only big difference is that we must handle the key and value tuple handed to us in each iteration. You can see both the naive and the dictionary comprehension approach in the code example in the slide. 38",Book 1_2036060.pdf,39,"Here are the notes on Dictionary Comprehensions in advanced markdown format:

### Dictionary Comprehensions
#### Definition
* A dictionary comprehension is a concise way to create dictionaries using a syntax similar to list comprehensions.

#### Structure
* The structure of a dictionary comprehension is similar to a list comprehension, with the key difference being the handling of the key and value tuple in each iteration.

#### Usage
* Dictionary comprehensions are useful when:
	+ Exploring data
	+ Building data transformations
	+ Working with data records from databases
	+ Extracting or parsing values from rows of data

#### Code Example
* Refer to the code example in the slide for a comparison of the naive approach and the dictionary comprehension approach.

"Before we proceed, let’s be clear about our philosophy in the code examples you will see in the lab exercises throughout this course. We believe it is far more important that code is comprehensible than it is efficient . This isn’t to say that efficient code isn’t important. However, we do believe that it is far more important to get your code to work, however inefficiently, before you worry about whether or not it could be accomplished in a better way. Donald Knuth, a very well-known figure in the field of computer science, author of the seminal “The Art of Computer Programming,” and creator of (among other things) T EX, the ancestor of the typesetting system used to produce this book, is known for having written and spoken extensively on his statement that, “premature optimization is the root of all evil.” What’s his point? Dr. Knuth was not saying that code should never be optimized. In fact, his work on formalizing mathematical models for computational complexity is the primary way that we measure code ef- ficiency even down to today! What he was pointing out is that programmers will often spend a tremendous amount of time optimizing code that has the least overall benefit to the efficiency of the entire system. This is what we are trying to say. For example, while we might be able to create some incredibly efficient (though inscrutably arcane) code for preprocessing a dataset to then train our machine learning model, we may have spent a great deal of time on a problem that only impacts the initial ingestion of data during training. In the grand scheme of how we use our machine learning solution, this code may be run only a handful of times! Instead, if we wish to optimize something, we should identify the parts of the code that most greatly impact performance, otherwise known as the critical path . With this understanding, you might think that this just sounds like common sense. Why do we have the tendency to optimize the wrong problems, then? The usual reason is that optimizing the critical path is very difficult, whereas optimizing things outside of this path tends to be much simpler by comparison. 39",Book 1_2036060.pdf,40,"Here are the notes on the philosophy of coding, summarizing the key concepts and highlighting important terms:

**Philosophy of Coding**
=========================

* **Comprehensibility over Efficiency**: Code should be easy to understand, even if it's not the most efficient.
* **Get it Working Before Optimizing**: Focus on getting the code to work, then worry about optimizing it.

**Donald Knuth's Philosophy**
---------------------------

* **Premature Optimization is the Root of All Evil**: Optimizing code too early can lead to wasted time on minor improvements.
* **Optimize the Critical Path**: Identify and optimize the parts of the code that most impact performance.

**Why We Optimize the Wrong Problems**
-----------------------------------

* **Difficulty of Optimizing the Critical Path**: Optimizing the critical path is hard, so we tend to optimize easier, less important parts of the code.

**Key Terms**
----------

* **Critical Path**: The parts of the code that most impact performance.
* **Premature Optimization**: Optimizing code too early, before it's necessary."
"Consider this example: a = [1, 2, 3] b = [10, 20, 30] c = [3, 2, 1] d = [x * y *  for y in a for  in b for x in c] This code is a trivial example of creating nested comprehensions. Can you predict what this code actually does? Look at it and think about that question. Does it produce an array that has three terms? Does it produce an array with six terms? Nine terms? 27 terms? We won’t answer this question now, but we will see this example in our lab so that we can explore it. Rather than starting with a nested list or dictionary comprehension, we would recommend that you write straightforward, naive code. Don’t worry if there’s a “better” or “more Pythonic” way to do it. First, worry about making it work. Once you have code that works, only start worrying about efficiency when you have a piece of code that will be run millions or billions of times. Wait until it is either affecting performance or until you can foresee that it will definitely affect performance. That is the time to worry about optimization. Another way to think about this problem is this. If we were most concerned about writing super efficient fast running code, would we be writing it in Python at all? 40",Book 1_2036060.pdf,41,"Here are the notes on the passage in advanced markdown format:

**Nested Comprehensions**
==========================

### Understanding the Code
#### Variables and Lists
* `a = [1, 2, 3]`
* `b = [10, 20, 30]`
* `c = [3, 2, 1]`

#### Nested Comprehension Example
* `d = [x * y *  for y in a for  in b for x in c]`
	+ Creates a nested comprehension
	+ Output array size unknown (3, 6, 9, or 27 terms?)

### Programming Philosophy
#### Worry About Correctness First
* Write straightforward, naive code to get it working
* Don't worry about efficiency initially

#### Optimize Later
* Only optimize code when:
	+ It affects performance
	+ It will be run millions or billions of times

#### Context: Python and Efficiency
* If efficiency is the top priority, Python might not be the best choice
* Prioritize correctness and simplicity over optimization"
"This isn’t to say that we can’t get highly performant solutions using Python. However, there are things that Python just isn’t great at. Since computational speed is one of those things, we need to supplement this weakness in some way. All modern machine learning solutions that have Python interfaces are implemented with NumPy arrays as their primary data structure. NumPy is an optimized numeric processing library for Python written in highly optimized C code. NumPy extends the concept of Python arrays, allowing us to create arrays of any number of dimensions and to mix types within each axis in an array. NumPy also supports some wonderfully useful ideas that are only possible through iteration with standard arrays, such as broadcasting . 41",Book 1_2036060.pdf,42,"Here are the notes in advanced bullet-point format:

* **Extends Python arrays**:
	+ Allows creation of arrays with any number of dimensions

"Let’s look at an example. Imagine that we have a Python two-dimensional array. The first axis, which we could think of as “rows,” represent students. The second dimension, which we could think of as “columns,” represents grades on specific examinations. Let’s consider how we might calculate some averages of these scores. print([sum(row)/len(row) for row in grades]) This first solution allows us to produce output that shows the average score of all exams for each student. What if we wanted to produce an average test score for each test regardless of the student? We can certainly do this, but if you take a moment to think about it, you quickly realize that this problem is less straightforward. Could you solve this with a list comprehension of some sort? Definitely. Would it be better to write this out with for loops first? Probably. Let’s look at these same problems using NumPy: numpy_grades = np.array(grades) print(np.average(numpy_grades, axis=1) print(np.average(numpy_grades, axis=0) That’s it! What’s happening in here? First, we take advantage of the fact that we can pass any Python array of any number of dimensions into the NumPy array constructor, and it will return a NumPy array with that same data inside of it. Next, we take advantage of some simple functions that are built into the Numpy library. But how do these axes work? We’ll consider that on the next slide; first, a word about broadcasting. Broadcasting allows us to take a NumPy array and perform an operation against it with either a single value or another array that might not be the same size, and NumPy makes that work. For example, if we take our array from above, numpy_grades , we could write: 42",Book 1_2036060.pdf,43,"Here are the notes in advanced bullet-point format:

**2D Array Operations in Python**
================================================

**Example: Student Grades**
-------------------------

* 2D array represents students (rows) and grades on specific examinations (columns)
* Calculate averages of scores

**Solution 1: Average Score per Student**
---------------------------------------

* Use list comprehension to produce output: `print([sum(row)/len(row) for row in grades])`
* Calculates average score of all exams for each student

**Solution 2: Average Score per Test**
-------------------------------------

* Calculate average test score for each test regardless of the student
* Can be solved using list comprehension or for loops
* Better to write with for loops first for clarity

**Using NumPy**
--------------

* Convert Python array to NumPy array: `numpy_grades = np.array(grades)`
* Calculate average scores:
	+ `print(np.average(numpy_grades, axis=1)`: average score per student
	+ `print(np.average(numpy_grades, axis=0)`: average score per test
* **Axis**: 0 corresponds to columns (tests), 1 corresponds to rows (students)

**Broadcasting in NumPy**
-------------------------

* Perform operations on NumPy arrays with single values or arrays of different sizes
* Example: `numpy_grades` + 42 (adds 42 to each element in the array)"
"numpy_grades = numpy_grades * 2 This will take the entire array elementwise, regardless of the number of dimensions in the array, and multiply each element by two. To accomplish this same task with Python using lists or arrays requires that we use the map() function, a list comprehension, or otherwise iterate over the entire array. This is just one of the enormous benefits of using the NumPy array type. 43",Book 1_2036060.pdf,44,"Here are the notes on the topic of NumPy array multiplication:

** NumPy Array Multiplication **
=============================

* **Element-wise multiplication**: NumPy arrays can be multiplied element-wise using the `*` operator.
	+ Example: `numpy_grades = numpy_grades * 2`
	+ This operation multiplies each element of the array by 2, regardless of the number of dimensions.
* **Benefits of NumPy arrays**:
	+ **Efficient**: NumPy arrays can perform element-wise operations without the need for iteration or mapping functions.
	+ **Concise**: NumPy arrays can accomplish tasks with fewer lines of code compared to Python lists or arrays.

Note: The `map()` function, list comprehensions, and iteration are not needed when using NumPy arrays, making them a more efficient and concise choice."
"One of the things that people struggle with most when first working with NumPy arrays is the notion of the axis that a function is being applied to. The simple rule of thumb, which may not seem intuitive, is that the axisisthe direction in which you wish to aggregate values. In our last example, we can choose to create an average for each student. Each student is found on axis 0, or each row. When we indicate that we want to apply our operation to axis=0 , we are looking across the rows. On the other hand, if we change this to be axis=1 , we are now summing or averaging the columns within the data. We can extend this idea to any number of directions since NumPy supports n-dimensional or arbitrary numbers of dimensions for arrays. Here’s a very simple way to work out which axis is which. If you are familiar with indexing arrays, consider the following. Imagine that we have a three dimensional array, which can be accessed as follows: value_in_array = marray[0][10][20] This is perfectly normal code, and a code-form you have likely been exposed to in the past. It is natural for someone with some mathematics background to think of the indices as 𝑥,𝑦, and 𝑧. Don’t do this! Instead, use a different metaphor. If we instead think of this as 𝑟𝑜𝑤,𝑐𝑜𝑙𝑢𝑚𝑛 , and 𝑔𝑟𝑖𝑑 , where 𝑔𝑟𝑖𝑑 represents which matrix or grid of values we are referring to in this ℝ3space, axes become very simple. Axis ero is the first dimension, or the row, axis one is the second dimension, or the column, and so on. While you and I likely have great difficulty picturing more than three or four dimensions, we will find that the idea of using tens, hundreds, or even thousands of dimensions is not terribly unusual. However, we will also discover that there are different ways of describing the dimensionality of data. 44",Book 1_2036060.pdf,45,"Here are the notes on the provided passage in advanced bullet-point markdown format:

**Understanding NumPy Arrays and Axis**
================================================

* **Axis**: direction in which values are aggregated
* **Axis 0 (Row)**: each student (row) in the example, where axis=0 aggregates values across rows
* **Axis 1 (Column)**: summing or averaging the columns within the data when axis=1

**Working with n-Dimensional Arrays**
--------------------------------------

* **NumPy supports n-dimensional arrays**
* **Indexing Arrays**: accessing values in an array, e.g., `marray[0][10][20]`

**Metaphor for Understanding Axis**
-------------------------------

* **Row, Column, Grid**: instead of thinking of indices as 𝑥,𝑦, and 𝑧, think of them as 𝑟𝑜𝑤, 𝑐𝑜𝑙𝑢𝑚𝑛, and 𝑔𝑟𝑖𝑑
* **Axis Index**: Axis 0 is the first dimension (row), Axis 1 is the second dimension (column), and so on

**Dealing with Higher Dimensionalities**
---------------------------------------

* **Tens, Hundreds, or Thousands of Dimensions**: not unusual in NumPy arrays
* **Different Ways of Describing Dimensionality**: various methods to describe data dimensionality will be encountered"
"We don’t want to digress too far, but we do want you to give some thought to the idea of dimen- sionality. People with a computer science or programming background tend to think of dimensions in terms of indices into a multidimensional array. There is absolutely nothing incorrect about that, but you will discover that we can describe dimensions somewhat differently in data science. If we are working with a three-dimensional array in Python using the built-in list or array types, we might have a pattern like this: a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] b = [2, 4, 6, 8] c = [1, 3, 5, 7] d = [a,b,c] e = [d,d,d] print(e[0][1][2]) Examine the code above. Can you predict which value will be printed? The answer is 6. We ask for the first row (offset ero), the second array (which we can think of as columns), and the third element. We can think of this mentally as x, y,  coordinates (0, 1, 2) . While this mental picture works, what if we had data with more dimensions? Most people reading that have a difficult time grasping what those dimensions must look like. Don’t bother! Forget that completely because as creatures living in an observably three-dimensional world, we cannot visu- alize what additional dimensions would look like. It turns out, however, that we have no problem working with multiple dimensions when we don’t realize it. For example, imagine that we conduct a survey. The survey collects a number of facts about partic- ipants, including: 45",Book 1_2036060.pdf,46,"**Dimensionality in Data Science**

* In data science, dimensions are described differently than in computer science or programming.
* A three-dimensional array in Python using built-in list or array types can be represented as:
	+ `a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
	+ `b = [2, 4, 6, 8]`
	+ `c = [1, 3, 5, 7]`

* Accessing elements in a multidimensional array:

"•Income •Age •Years of education •Ethnicity •Religion •Gender It would be reasonable to think of (Income, Age, Education, Ethnicity, Reli- gion, Gender) as coordinates that represent a specific person. Indeed, if more than one person has the same coordinates, we could view them as equal from the point of view of the information that we have about them. You likely have no problem relating to this concept.

"It’s now time for us to jump in and work on a lab. As is true with anything, talking about the task will rarely teach us how to do it.

"Matplotlib and Plotting Basics In this section, we’re going to take a look at how we can go about taking our data and turning it into useful visualizations. In order to do this, we will be looking at a commonly used Python library called Matplotlib. This free, open-source solution is widely used in its primary form, but you will also find that it also exists as the main library leveraged by many other graphing and visualization solutions available for Python. While there is far more to this library than we will cover here, we do want to cover a few of the basics before we get you to work hands-on with it in our lab. We will also expand on some of the topics that are covered here, in addition to examining more features as we make use of this and other graphing capabilities throughout the labs in this course. 49",Book 1_2036060.pdf,50,"Here are the notes on Matplotlib and Plotting Basics in advanced markdown format:

"The reason that we need a tool like this one is that we will frequently want to be able to visualize our data. This is a very important aspect of the exploration phase, which we will examine in-depth in book two. The exploration phase is focused on getting to know what’s in our data and trying to identify relationships in addition to interesting facts about our data that we can leverage throughout the data analysis process. This allows us to transform data into a visual representation. This done, we can look at one or more fields or perhaps examine multiple fields in comparison to one another. We might even perform correlation analysis and create a visual representation of how closely tied together, or perhaps even unrelated, fields are. It is also not unusual to make use of visualizations as part of the output phase of whatever machine learning or a visualization/analysis process we’re trying to create. Even if the output of our system will not be visual, we will still be able to leverage visualizations during the training process to measure how well our models are performing. We will look at this as we work through TensorFlow and work with TensorBoard to visualize The performance of our models as we are training them. TensorBoard uses matplotlib under the hood. 50",Book 1_2036060.pdf,51,"**Data Visualization**

"A tremendous advantage to using this library is that since it is used in almost every other graphing library as the underlying toolset, we will be in a very good position to make use of almost any other visualization tool available in Python. Since the stool is still actively developed, unlike some other alternative solutions, we can also have some confidence that we will be able to use this tool not only today but for some time into the future. Even though this is a free library, it is still full-featured. It supports almost any kind of graph that you can imagine. Certainly, there are libraries that build on top of matplotlib that create much more attractive looking plots, but from our point of view, we are much more interested in how useful the graph is than we are in how pretty it might look. There is one thing to be mindful of when using this tool for visualizations. The more points you attempt to graph, the slower it will be. Anecdotally, our experience is that the labels that are added to the data, even if they are only the labels for the tick marks on the axes, can dramatically impact performance. You may want to bear this in mind if you are trying to visualize a large set of data and it is taking a very long time to complete. 51",Book 1_2036060.pdf,52,"Here are the notes on the provided passage about the Matplotlib library in advanced markdown format:

**Advantages of Using Matplotlib**
====================================

* **Wide compatibility**: Used in almost every other graphing library as the underlying toolset, making it easy to transition to other visualization tools.
* **Actively developed**: Still maintained and updated, ensuring its relevance for future use.
* **Full-featured**: Supports almost any kind of graph imaginable.
* **Functionality over aesthetics**: Focus on usefulness over visual appeal.

**Important Consideration**
-------------------------

* **Performance impact**: The more points you attempt to graph, the slower the performance will be.
* **Labeling impact**: Adding labels, even just tick marks on axes, can significantly impact performance, especially with large datasets.

"When using this library, we will usually only import one main portion of it. This is the pyplot section of the library, and by convention, we typically import it with the mnemonic plt. Once we have this imported, there are just a few basics required to get a graph upon our display. Of course, we need to have some data to graph, so in the slide, we are creating a set of random values. The function that we are using to create random values comes out of NumPy. The np.random() call allows us to specify any number of random values that we would like NumPy to produce. The random values will be returned in a NumPy array. In this case, we have added the normal method to this call, which allows us to specify that we would like the values to have a normal distribution. We will talk a bit more about what a normal distribution is in our statistics section. This function takes three parameters. The first is the average value around which we would like our random value centered. The second is the width of the standard deviation, which we will define tomorrow. The last is the number of values that we would like to produce. Having created the data, we can simply call the plt.plot() function, passing in the array as the data to be plotted. While this would be sufficient within a Jupyter notebook if the creation of the plot is the last item in the cell, we really should be in the habit of calling the plt.show() method to cause it to be displayed. This is especially important if we’re creating multiple graphs. We can make adjustments to this plot all the way up until the time the show method is called. However, if we were to create this graph and then immediately create another without ever calling the show method, our first graph would be lost. 52",Book 1_2036060.pdf,53,"**matplotlib** and **NumPy** for Data Visualization
=============================================

**Importing matplotlib**
--------------------

* Import the `pyplot` section of the `matplotlib` library, conventionally imported as `plt`.

**Creating Random Data**
---------------------

* Use `np.random()` from **NumPy** to generate random values.
* Specify the number of random values to produce.
* Use the `normal` method to generate values with a **normal distribution**.
* The `normal` method takes three parameters:
	+ **Average value** (center of the distribution)
	+ **Standard deviation** (width of the distribution)
	+ **Number of values** to produce

**Plotting the Data**
-------------------

* Use `plt.plot()` to create a graph, passing in the array of random values as the data to be plotted.
* **Call `plt.show()` to display the graph**, especially when creating multiple graphs.

**Important Notes**
-----------------

* If not calling `plt.show()`, the graph will not be displayed, and subsequent graphs will overwrite the previous one.
* Adjustments to the plot can be made until `plt.show()` is called."
"We will frequently want to create multiple graphs out of a set of data. Perhaps our data has multiple columns, and we would like to create a graph for each column so that we can compare one to another. Another possibility is that we would like to create different graphs of the same data, with each plot visualizing it in a different way. We may also be dealing with a situation where we would like to render a number of different images, perhaps in a grid. All of these things can be accomplished using subplots. When we call the plt.subplots() method from the library, it will return a tuple containing the figure object in which all of the subplots plots are held and an array containing all of the subplots requested. The plt.subplots() method call takes a single argument. This argument can be a single number to indicate how many plots there should be. You can also pass a tuple indicating how many rows and columns of subplots should be created. Once we have created the subplots, we can utilize each one of them to plot data using any of the different visualization methods. In the case we have in the slide, we are looking at the same data in two different ways. We are not limited to this. We might look at different pieces of data in different subplots. We could also choose to use some of the subplots for graphs and others for other types of visualizations. Each subplot can contain any rendering that the matplotlib library supports. This would include images, text, or other elements. 53",Book 1_2036060.pdf,54,"Here are the notes in advanced bullet-point format:

**Subplots in Matplotlib**

* A way to create multiple graphs out of a set of data
* Useful for comparing multiple columns of data or visualizing the same data in different ways
* Can also be used to render multiple images, such as in a grid

### Creating Subplots

* Can pass a tuple to specify the number of rows and columns of subplots

### Using Subplots
* Each subplot can be used to plot data using various visualization methods
* Can visualize the same data in different ways or show different pieces of data
* Each subplot can contain:
	+ **Graphs**: using various visualization methods
	+ **Images**: rendered using the Matplotlib library
	+ **Text**: or other elements supported by the library

"Generating subplots is a very common task. There are different strategies for handling these sub- plots, but one of the easiest is to make use of the flat attribute and then enumerate the array in a loop or comprehension. Please take note that this is an attribute and not a method! While some doc- umentation says that this creates a copy of the array, it is much more accurate to say that it creates an iterable reference to the array. This iterable reference allows us to view the array as a flattened, one-dimensional structure. Since the enumeration isn’t creating a new copy but instead is giving us references to the individ- ual subplots, this provides a very easy way to sequentially populate each plot without having to keep track of which row or column we’re in. As you can see in the example on the slide, we can simply refer to each of the subplots using the index from the enumeration. Also, take note that the plt.show() method is only called after all subplots have been rendered. Calling it before this will prevent the following subplots from being displayed. 54",Book 1_2036060.pdf,55,"Here are the notes on generating subplots in advanced markdown format:

**Generating Subplots**
=======================

### Strategies for Handling Subplots
* Using the `flat` attribute and enumerating the array in a loop or comprehension is an easy strategy.

### The `flat` Attribute
* **Not a method, but an attribute**.
* Creates an **iterable reference** to the array, allowing it to be viewed as a flattened, one-dimensional structure.
* Does not create a copy of the array.

### Benefits
* Enables easy sequential population of each plot without tracking row or column indices.
* References individual subplots using the index from the enumeration.

### Important Note
* **Call `plt.show()` only after all subplots have been rendered**.
* Calling it before may prevent subsequent subplots from being displayed."
"This library has a tremendous number of features. It is also, unfortunately, one of the least intuitive libraries that we will make use of in this class. Given how important visualization is, however, it is definitely worth our time to work through some exercises to make sure that we understand it well enough to be able to use it with some facility rather than having to look up the manual pages every single time we want to create a plot. One of the problems that we will solve in the lab is what to do when our subplots begin to become crowded. As this happens, the text on the axes or perhaps in the titling will become unreadable. We look at some easy ways to solve this in addition to some ways that we may choose to customize this to move legends and titles inside of the graph. We will also look at how to go about adjusting the overall size of the graph, change the type of lines that are used in rendering the graphs, how to adjust colors, and several other features. There truly are many different tricks to using this library. Even after the introduction that we cover in our lab today, you will continue to learn about additional features in this library for the next several days. 55",Book 1_2036060.pdf,56,"**Matplotlib Library Notes**

"SQL Crash Course In this section, we will try to give you a fast and practical introduction to the SQL language and relational databases in general.

"The SQL language has been around for many years. It represented a revolution that changed how data was stored and structured. Most databases prior to the creation of SQL were based on ISAM, VSAM, or other proprietary database technologies. Both of these technologies still exist today (and are used!), but SQL has dominated this space for decades. Even in cases where ISAM tables are used to store the data, SQL is most frequently the interface that is used to access this data. The SQL language is a DSL1that can be broken into four main pieces. One part, the DDL (Data Definition Language), is used to describe the structure or schema of the database. This includes the creation of the data tables and the various fields, often called columns, that are found within each of those tables. Another, the DML (Data Manipulation Language), is used for making changes to rows within database tables. This includes inserting, updating, deleting, and other operations that cause changes to occur to the data within the fields. The third is the DCL (Data Control Language)2. This is used for defining data access and authorization requirements and restrictions that are applied to databases, tables, rows, or columns. While these three are quite important, we are not particularly interested in them if our only goal is to be able to extract data from the database for data analysis or machine learning purposes. Certainly, if you have the time, we recommend that you spend time learning about the DDL dialect used by database products within your enterprise so that you can well understand the different data types available in those servers. The aspect of SQL that we care a lot about is the DQL(Data Query Language). This is the part of the language that allows us to request data out of the database. This language can be quite complex since we are dealing with relational data. This means that the data in one table can be used to access data from another. We will get into that in just a little while. 1Domain Specific Language 2In the event you choose to research this, you should be aware that there have been several other computer languages that use the abbreviation “DCL.” 58",Book 1_2036060.pdf,59,"Here are the notes on the SQL language:
**What is SQL?**
* A revolution in data storage and structuring that has dominated the space for decades
* A **Domain Specific Language (DSL)** used to interact with databases

**Importance of DQL**
* Crucial for extracting data from databases for data analysis or machine learning purposes"
"Even though the language that we use to access the database can be very complex, or at least can be used to create very complex queries, the ideas behind a relational database are not very complicated at all. The mental picture that you can use is that of a set of Excel worksheets. Each sheet has rows and columns, where each row has information about one specific record. The columns within that sheet are used to store facts about each one of those rows or records. What we have so far would be called a table. When we take multiple tables and put them together (think of an Excel workbook) we now have a database. Therefore, a database can be defined as a collection of tables, each of which contains rows made up of columns or fields that contain infor- mation. Even though this is a database, it can’t be described as a relational database yet. For it to be a relational database, we would expect that some of the data in the various tables are related to or connected to rows in other tables. On the right-hand side of our slide, we have a piece of what is known as an entity-relationship diagram, or ERD. These diagrams depict the relationships between the different tables and show the structure of the data within the tables. In this particular diagram, the “Customer Data” database has four different tables within it. These tables each have various pieces of information or fields that are somehow connected to the customer. You can see that there are lines connecting these tables to one another. There are also lines that run off of our diagram that connect these tables with tables in other databases. These lines indicate the relations that exist. For example, if you look at the address table, you will see that there is a field called city_id . This field represents what is called aforeign key from the city table. In other words, when we store an address, we don’t actually store the city related to it. Instead, we only store the city_id of the corresponding city record where this address is located. These relationships can become very complex, and there are both benefits and disadvantages to using SQL databases. 59",Book 1_2036060.pdf,60,"Here are the notes on relational databases in advanced bullet-point format:

**Relational Databases**
========================
### What is a Database?
* A database is a collection of **tables**, each containing **rows** made up of **columns** or **fields** that contain information.

### Understanding Tables
* A table consists of rows and columns, similar to an Excel worksheet.
* Each row represents a specific record, and each column stores facts about that record.

### Relational Database
* A database becomes a **relational database** when tables are connected, with relationships between rows in different tables.

### Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)
* An ERD is a diagram that depicts the relationships between tables and shows the structure of the data within the tables.
* ERDs include lines connecting tables to show relationships.

### Fields and Foreign Keys
* A **foreign key** is a field in a table that refers to a record in another table.
* Example: In an address table, the `city_id` field is a foreign key that refers to a record in the city table.

### Benefits and Drawbacks of SQL Databases
* Using SQL databases can have both benefits and drawbacks, including complexity in relationships."
"The Data Query Language The DQL can be very simple and straightforward to use. One of the design goals for the original version of what has become SQL was to create a query language that expressed itself in something close the English. When we look at the most basic queries, this is certainly true. After connecting to the database server, we must tell the server which database we wish to work with. When working interactively, we do this using the use <database> command. Once this has been done, all of the tables within that database can be easily accessed. It is possible to query tables in other databases as well, but this isn’t a common use case for us. Once the database has been selected, we can now request data. To do so, we use the SELECT statement. These days the case of SQL statements is not particularly important, but traditionally the SQL language portions of our statements are capitalized. Many DBAs (database administrators) and programmers prefer this convention since it makes the SQL language portions stand out from the tables, fields, and data. We will not be pedantic about this in our class. The general format of theSELECT statement is: SELECT <* | column[, column, ...]> FROM <table> [WHERE <condition>] Here we have used the standard convention of indicating required arguments using the <>and optional arguments using []. In aSELECT command, we specify which columns we are interested in seeing out of the rows that are selected. If you aren’t sure what the names of the columns or fields are, you can ask for *, which returns all fields for the selected rows. We must also specify which table we are interested in querying with the FROM clause. The WHERE clause is optional; it allows us to limit which rows are returned using some selection criteria. These basic select statements are very straightforward and easy to grasp. Let’s make them slightly 60",Book 1_2036060.pdf,61,"**Data Query Language (DQL)**
=============================

### Design Goals

* Create a query language that is easy to use and close to English
* Simple and straightforward queries

### Connecting to the Database

* Use the `use <database>` command to select the database to work with
* Allows access to all tables within the selected database
* Optional: query tables in other databases

### SELECT Statement

* Format: `SELECT <* | column[, column, ...]> FROM <table> [WHERE <condition>]`
* **Required arguments**: `<*>` or column names, `FROM <table>`
* **Optional arguments**: `WHERE <condition>`
* `*` returns all fields for the selected rows
* `WHERE` clause is optional, used to limit returned rows based on selection criteria

### SQL Conventions

* SQL language portions are typically capitalized (but not enforced in this class)
* Used to distinguish SQL language from tables, fields, and data"
"more complex. One of the strengths of using an RDBMS is the fact that it is a relational database. It is, therefore, very common to link tables together in queries. Here’s a basic example of using a relation: SELECT users.name, orders.number, orders.total FROM orders INNER JOIN users ON users.id=orders.userid This looks far more complicated, but there’s really not much more happening. We are asking to see thename column from the users table in addition to the number andtotal columns from the orders table. Wow! This means that we are extracting columns from two tables at the same time. How does it know which records to show us from the orders table with the data from the users table? Notice the INNER JOIN clause. This expresses that we want to see orders rows for each user where the users.id value is the same as the orders.userid value. 61",Book 1_2036060.pdf,62,"Here are the advanced bullet-point notes summarizing the topic of Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS) and SQL queries:

**Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS)**
================================================================================

* A strength of RDBMS is the ability to link tables together in queries
* This is possible due to the relational nature of the database

**Basic SQL Query with INNER JOIN**
-----------------------------------

* Example query: `SELECT users.name, orders.number, orders.total FROM orders INNER JOIN users ON users.id=orders.userid`
* The query extracts columns from **two tables**:
	+ `users` table: `name` column
	+ `orders` table: `number` and `total` columns
* The **INNER JOIN** clause links the two tables based on a common column:
	+ `users.id` = `orders.userid`
* The query returns only the rows from the `orders` table where the `userid` matches the `id` in the `users` table"
"From our perspective as budding data scientists, we are fortunate that we need not overly concern ourselves with the design of the database or tables. This isn’t to say that we never care, however. For example, we might be working on an ETL (Export, Transform, Load) task where we are attempting to query multiple tables in multiple databases simultaneously in order to aggregate and transform that data in an important and useful way for our enterprise. Once that transformation has been done, whether it is a simple aggregation, analysis, or MapReduce style operation, the results might be loaded into some other data store (possibly even a SQL database). In a case such as this, we would need a great deal of knowledge of the structure of the data tables queried. An important mental key to working with SQL is to view the operations as manipulations of sets of data. If we use this mental picture rather than viewing things as rows and columns, the various operations tend to make a bit more sense. The queries themselves can end up looking incredibly complex, but ultimately we are just mixing, matching, and manipulating sets of data. 62",Book 1_2036060.pdf,63,"Here are the advanced bullet-point notes on the topic:

**Database and SQL Basics**
=============================

* **ETL (Export, Transform, Load)**: a process that involves querying multiple tables in multiple databases, aggregating and transforming data for enterprise use.
* **Database design**: not a primary concern for data scientists, but important to understand table structure in certain scenarios (e.g., ETL tasks).

**Working with SQL**
---------------

* **Mental model**: view SQL operations as manipulations of **sets of data**, rather than rows and columns.
* **SQL operations**: involve mixing, matching, and manipulating sets of data.
* **Query complexity**: can appear complex, but can be understood by applying the sets of data mental model."
"Just to give you a concrete example of what a somewhat more complex query might look like, consider the example in the slide. This SQL query is a mixture of Ruby code and SQL. The database is used to store log events from Windows event logs and various system logs from routers, switches, and UNIX systems. One of the criteria for the system design was that it be very responsive when it comes to arbitrary text searches across events. The developers took an interesting approach to solve this problem. When an event is stored, it is first broken into discrete words. The system evaluates each word, checking to see if that word has ever been seen before. If it has, it retrieves the unique ID for that word. If it hasn’t, the word is inserted into the words table, and the ID is captured. Now that all of the IDs are available, the system stores rows into the events_words table, which links the events tables to the words table, storing both the event_id andword_id for every word found in an event. Later, when someone wants to query these tables, the code in the slide is executed. This takes the list of search terms that are passed in by the user, expands them out to create multiple LIKE clauses in a nested SQL query, and then finds all events that have all of those words present. The query itself looks complicated since there are so many pieces happening. Indeed, this could have been accomplished in multiple discrete steps, first retrieving and storing the words, then retrieving the events, then performing the aggregation. While this would be more tractable to read, the perfor- mance would suffer greatly. By writing it as a set of nested queries, the SQL server can do this in a highly optimized way, simply generating intersections of the relative sets and returning final results rather than creating and returning three different sets of results. When working with SQL databases, you will frequently hear the term “Normalized” or “First Nor- mal Form” or some other “Normal Form.” What do these mean? A normal form defines a standard way of representing data that seeks to minimize duplication. How much duplication has been elim- 63",Book 1_2036060.pdf,64,"Here are the notes on the provided passage in advanced bullet-point markdown format:

**Database Query Optimization**
=================================

* **System Design Criteria**: Very responsive to arbitrary text searches across events
* **Event Storage**:
	+ Break down each event into discrete words
	+ Check if each word has been seen before
		- If yes, retrieve unique ID
		- If no, insert into **words table** and capture ID
* **Events-Words Table**:
	+ Links **events table** to **words table**
	+ Stores **event_id** and **word_id** for every word in an event

**Query Execution**
-------------------

* **Search Query**:
	+ Expand search terms into multiple LIKE clauses in a nested SQL query
	+ Find all events with all search terms present
* **Optimization**:
	+ Writing the query as a set of nested queries allows the SQL server to optimize performance
	+ Generates intersections of relative sets and returns final results

**Database Normalization**
-------------------------

* **Normalized** or **First Normal Form**: A standard way to represent data to minimize duplication
* **Goal**: Eliminate duplication in data representation"
"inated and how highly optimized the data storage depends on how far we go with normalization. In common use, you will find first normal form (1NF) and second normal form (2NF) databases. This isn’t to say that they can’t be third or more, but they are definitely more rare to encounter. The entire idea behind normalization is eliminating duplication in the database and speeding access and uniqueness of indices. That’s it. First normal form means that every column in a table contains only a single value (rather than a composite value) and that there is some field within the aggregate rows that is row-wise unique in the table. This unique field serves as an index. Second normal form extends this such that there is no duplication across table joins. In other words, everything in the right side of the join is unique to everything on the left side of the join. This results in faster access since the result sets should be commensurately smaller, or at least more specific to what you are retrieving. There is no value for us in exploring the other normal forms since you are less likely to encounter them and since we are not trying to teach an RDBMS class. Just take away from this that normaliza- tion is about reducing the number of times we store the same data, preferably making data unique. While higher levels of normalization are often better, they are not always better. We are trading off data storage (we need less space to store more highly normalized data) for access time (it will typically take more time to reconstruct data that has been highly normalized). 64",Book 1_2036060.pdf,65,"Here are the notes on database normalization:

**Database Normalization**
==========================

**Purpose**
-----------

* Eliminate duplication in the database
* Speed up access and ensure uniqueness of indices

**First Normal Form (1NF)**
---------------------------

* Each column in a table contains only a **single value** (not composite)
* There is a **unique field** in the table, serving as an index
* Ensures **row-wise uniqueness** in the table

**Second Normal Form (2NF)**
---------------------------

* Extends 1NF to ensure **no duplication** across table joins
* Everything on the right side of the join is **unique** to everything on the left side
* Results in **faster access** and smaller result sets

**Importance of Normalization**
-----------------------------

* Reduces the number of times the same data is stored
* Aims to make data **unique**
* Higher levels of normalization:
	+ Trade-off: **less data storage** for **longer access time**
	+ Not always better, as highly normalized data can be slower to reconstruct"
"SQL Joins There are many types of joins or ways of relating tables to one another. The list in our slide is by no means complete. In fact, you will find that there are different ways of expressing the same join. What some would call a Difference join, others would call an Outer join. Knowing this at the outset is useful. We want to provide you with some fairly standard vocabulary, but don’t get too hung up on the precise names for things since different vendors and different experts may use slightly different terminology. In the context of this class, we will define the joins as follows: Join Meaning Inner Select rows from the table on the “left” (table A), returning the column values from rows in both the left and right tables where the fields in table B are related through a foreign key in A. Left Perform an inner join where possible, but if there are rows in table A with no matches in table B, return the table A rows anyway with the columns from B set to null. Outer Also called a Full Outer Join and sometimes a Union. Return all of the rows in A, whether there are relations in B, all of the rows in A where there are relations in B, and all of the rows in B where there were no relations in A. In other words, return everything . Cross Not all database servers support a cross join. The idea is to return all permutations of the rows in column A with the related rows in table B. Right The opposite of a Left join. Return all of the rows from table B where there are relations in table A. 65",Book 1_2036060.pdf,66,"Here are the notes on SQL Joins in advanced markdown format:

**SQL Joins**
================

### Types of Joins
------------------

* Multiple types of joins exist, and different vendors/experts may use different terminology
* We will define the joins as follows:

### Inner Join
-------------

* **Select** rows from the table on the ""left"" (table A)
* Return column values from rows in both left and right tables where the fields in table B are related through a foreign key in A

### Left Join
------------

* Perform an inner join where possible
* If there are rows in table A with no matches in table B, return the table A rows anyway with the columns from B set to **null**

### Outer Join (Full Outer Join, Union)
-----------------------------

* Return **all** of the rows in A, whether there are relations in B
* Return all of the rows in A where there are relations in B
* Return all of the rows in B where there were no relations in A
* In other words, return **everything**

### Cross Join
-------------

* Not all database servers support a cross join
* Return all **permutations** of the rows in column A with the related rows in table B

### Right Join
-------------

* The opposite of a Left join
* Return all of the rows from table B where there are relations in table A"
Join Meaning Difference Also called an Outer join by some. Return all of the rows in the two tables where there are norelations between them. 66,Book 1_2036060.pdf,67,"Here are the notes on the provided passage:

### Outer Join
* Also known as a **Full Outer Join**
* Returns all rows from **both tables** where there are **no relations** between them."
"We have attempted to picture the most common joins in the images in the slide. It is often easier to understand what is happening in the joins by visualizing what they mean. As with our definitions of join types on the previous page, do not assume that these are all of the possible joins. There are many more ways that we can mix and match our tables, and there are many other words that you might find an administrator or documentation using to describe a particular join. In our experience, the best way to disambiguate how the data is being retrieved is to force someone to draw a diagram to illustrate it. 67",Book 1_2036060.pdf,68,"Here are the notes on the topic of joins in a concise and easy-to-understand format:

**Understanding Joins**

* Visualizing joins can help in understanding what is happening in the joins
* The images provided are not exhaustive and only show the most common types of joins
* There are many more ways to mix and match tables and use different words to describe joins
* It is essential to clarify how data is being retrieved
* **Best practice:** Force someone to draw a diagram to illustrate the join to avoid confusion"
"In addition to being able to join or relate data in one or more tables simultaneously, most SQL server implementations support a variety of aggregation and grouping functions. Aggregation means that we are collecting data and summarizing it in some way. Grouping means that we are putting all related records together in one section. The aggregation options largely revolve around simple statistics operations that we might want to perform on our data. This can be very useful when our data has been stored properly, allowing us to perform calculations very rapidly across vast numbers of rows. Unfortunately, sometimes we find that the data is not stored using ideal typing, which might mean that these operations cannot be used. For example, if we’ve stored currency values in a string field with a currency indicator, we cannot easily use the AVG,SUM,MAX,MIN, or other operators on that data. We would first have to transform the data, which is significantly more expensive. The worst case is always to extract the data from the database and then perform our aggregation. Just because it’s the worst-case doesn’t mean that we won’t do it. We will talk about a variety of statistical operations in the following days, many of which are extremely useful but completely unavailable in the SQL language. 68",Book 1_2036060.pdf,69,"Here are the notes on SQL Server Implementations in advanced markdown format:

"We have only scratched the surface when it comes to SQL and the various complexities of writing queries. Since we are only focused on practical applications from a data science perspective, we are solely interested in getting you enough familiarity to be able to run basic queries. With that knowledge, you will be able to extract data from databases on your own. You should also be in a much better position to know what to type in as a set of search terms to your favorite search engine when you need to go further. At a minimum, you should be in a better position to look up the documentation for the specific SQL dialect supported by your enterprise’s SQL server. When interacting with SQL servers, don’t be shy about talking to your DBAs as well. A data scientist has broad knowledge covering programming and data access languages. A DBA has very specific and deep expertise in administering SQL servers and optimizing queries. Leverage the expertise that these people have! We are often surprised at the counterintuitive recommendations a DBA will make regarding our own SQL queries.

"NoSQL Document Stores As powerful as SQL is, it isn’t always the best way to go. While SQL databases can allow us to deduplicate data reducing in more efficient usage of space and can also allow us to create powerful joins of data across multiple tables or even databases, another approach sacrifices space for even more efficient retrieval performance. This is the general motivation behind the NoSQL paradigm and document stores. 71",Book 1_2036060.pdf,72,"Here are the notes on NoSQL Document Stores in advanced markdown format:

"These types of databases come in two main flavors. The first is a document store, of which Mon- goDB is an example. The second is a key-value store, an example of which is CouchDB. All databases in these categories fall into the “NoSQL” class. In a document store, the documents themselves can have any structure we would like. The data within the document store is organized into collections . We can think of a collection as a table in a SQL database. The visibility into the contents of the document within a collection is one of the real strengths of a document store. Another strength in this type of database is when we retrieve a document, all of the data associated with the document comes along. While this can lead to significant data duplication and greater disk utilization, it also means that the retrieval of data is very fast and can far exceed the speed of a SQL database. Why is this? Because we don’t need to access multiple tables or databases to retrieve the relevant record and all of the related fields from other tables. The other advantage of using a document store over a key-value store is that we can use elements or fields within the documents in our searches, rather than being limited to only using the keys. In other words, this would be like having a SQL database where the only way you can look up any record in any table is with the ID field. A key-value store is very similar, except the contents of the documents are completely opaque. Since we cannot see or query based on the content of the documents, it makes no difference whether the documents have an internal structure or if they are just binary blobs of data. Queries, as a result, are very highly optimized. However, it can also be very limiting since there is no way to do a relation of any kind. In this class, we will use document stores rather than key-value stores. In our experience, document stores are more common to find in enterprises today, while key-value stores are more purpose-built systems used in more of a niche role. 72",Book 1_2036060.pdf,73,"Here are the notes on the topic of NoSQL databases, specifically document stores and key-value stores:

**NoSQL Databases**

"MongoDB In our class, we will make use of the MongoDB database as an example of a document store. We have chosen to use Mongo with this class since it is both simple to use and is a relatively lightweight database solution. In a variety of our exercises throughout the course, we may want to temporarily store data into some kind of data store rather than a simple flat file. In these cases, we will often use Mongo as this temporary storage medium. While SQL databases could certainly be used as well, creating a SQL database requires more upfront work and can be more challenging. The structure of the entire database must be defined upfront. Using a document store, we can define the structure of elements that we care about and simply put elements that are less important into unstructured data fields for analysis at some future time. Additionally, SQL databases can be somewhat heavy in terms of system resources, especially if we are using a laptop or workstation for our data research. Of course, if you are interacting with your enterprise data store, you must use whichever language it exposes to you. These days, large enterprises usually use both traditional SQL databases and newer document stores; which storage solution is used is determined by the specific use case of the application. However, our experience is that medium to small enterprises that have existed for more than 10 years will tend to use SQL servers only, while very new tech startups will tend toward document stores. When working with Mongo and most other document stores, the primary mechanism for defining objects is JSON. JSON, or JavaScript Object Notation, isn’t difficult to understand, but it can take some getting used to if you haven’t worked with it before. The more difficult aspect of working with JSON in document stores is that all of our queries are also structured as JSON objects that are passed to the document store. This can be quite challenging when you were first beginning to interact with this type of database, especially when you come from a SQL background. 73",Book 1_2036060.pdf,74,"Here are the advanced bullet-point notes summarizing the important parts of the passage about MongoDB:

"To make our lives easier, we will make use of the MongoEngine Python library. This leverages a lower-level library called PyMongo. In our lab, we will look at both MongoEngine and PyMongo. While our preference would be to use MongoEngine only, there are some tasks that we will need to do when exploring data that we will require either a Mongo command line or a PyMongo script. Since we are most interested in generalizing our work so that it is repeatable, we will take the time to learn a few elements of the PyMongo library to make this possible. 74",Book 1_2036060.pdf,75,"**MongoDB and Python Libraries**

"It might surprise you to hear that large enterprises and small have moved to document stores over traditional databases. There are good reasons for this shift. We should acknowledge, though, that some organizations make use of document store technologies without adequately understanding the strengths and weaknesses of this technology. One of the greatest strengths of a document store over a traditional SQL database is that the schema of the database can be changed very quickly and easily. In an SQL environment, changing the schema requires that every existing record in the database is updated to match the new design. If you have ever worked through performing a database migration1, then you appreciate how fraught with peril such an update is. What happens when a particular record is structured slightly differently than what is expected? Will the adjustment be made properly during the migration? Will the migration fail halfway through? What happens to existing applications that expect the design to have a specific structure and that structure has changed? All of these things make changing the schema a very challenging process in a traditional database. Changing the design of a document using Mongo is trivial. Do you have a new field that you would like to add? Just add it. There is no need to go back and add it to every existing record unless you want to. Would you like to remove the field? Then remove it! You don’t actually have to update the data to make such a change. Of course, you can run into trouble if you change data types. The database may not care very much, but your applications definitely will. Since the design of the data is so flexible, it is very easy to go quickly from an idea to code that is storing data. With a traditional database, we must spend a great deal of time thinking about the design of the data. Since a document store allows us to restructure the data on the fly, much less upfront design time is required. We should mention that while this is a strength, this can also be a 1Database migrations are the copying and updating of the content of database tables when the underlying schema is changed. 75",Book 1_2036060.pdf,76,"Here are the advanced bullet-point notes summarizing the passage on document stores and traditional SQL databases:

**Advantages of Document Stores over Traditional SQL Databases**
================================================================================

**Schema Flexibility**
* In a document store, the schema can be changed quickly and easily without updating every existing record
* In a traditional SQL database, changing the schema requires updating every existing record, making it a challenging process
* In document stores, adding or removing fields is trivial and does not require updating existing records

**Rapid Development**
* The flexible design of document stores allows for quick development, with less upfront design time required
* With a traditional database, a great deal of time is spent thinking about the design of the data

**Challenges with Schema Changes**
* Changing data types in a document store can cause problems, as applications may not be compatible with the new data type
* In traditional SQL databases, schema changes can cause issues with existing applications that expect a specific structure

**Key Concepts**
* **Document store**: a NoSQL database that stores data in documents, allowing for flexible schema changes
* **Schema migration**: the process of updating a database schema, which can be challenging in traditional SQL databases

"great weakness. This can certainly lead to developers simply writing code without doing anydesign. In no way are we suggesting that that is a good idea. One of the greatest strengths to operating a document store, and the main reason that an enterprise would choose to do so, is the retrieval speed. While we can create relationships between documents within a collection or between collections, the use case for which the systems are designed is that all of the data related to a record is stored together as a single document. This means that we are trading off the size of the data being stored (relatively large in a document store) with the speed of retrieval (very fast in a document store). 76",Book 1_2036060.pdf,77,"Here are the notes on the provided passage:

**Document Store**

**Weaknesses**

* One potential weakness is a lack of design, leading to poorly written code.

**Strengths**

* **Retrieval Speed**: One of the greatest strengths of a document store is its fast retrieval speed.
* **Data Storage**: All related data is stored together as a single document, allowing for efficient retrieval.
* **Trade-off**: The document store trades off larger data storage sizes for fast retrieval speeds.

"While these benefits are wonderful, there are some potential deficiencies. While our course is not focused on securing things, since our domain expertise is in the field of information security, it is notable that vulnerable document store installations are rampant. It takes minutes or possibly even seconds to stand up a new document store. You can immediately begin to interact with it. Unfortunately, the default deployment will be terribly insecure if remote connections are enabled. While we are not aware of any studies to back this up, our experience is that the state of security of the deployment of document stores is far worse than that of SQL databases. While SQL databases can also be configured insecurely, since they are more complex systems and won’t “just work,” administrators tend to spend more time making sure the configuration is correct. There are other aspects of using a document store that are not so good. For example, if your use case requires that data is retrieved using anything other than the default _id field within the collection, the performance of the retrieval will not be optimal. It is possible to create additional indices for other fields within a document or even for subdocuments with the documents in a collection. If this is being done frequently in a project, it calls into question the decision to use a document store over a SQL database. Since we are now adding additional indices and are likely writing queries that look very much like SQL joins, we are losing all of the speed and performance benefits that a document store provides. In other words, if we are using the document store like a SQL database, why aren’t we just using SQL? Another potential downside, which might not matter that much to you, is that the high retrieval speed comes at the sacrifice of space. When creating a document store, we do not worry about normalization at all. This means that you will likely have a great deal of duplication within the database. This can feel really wrong for people who come from an SQL background. In fact, while we will likely have some degree of duplication, you can probably sense that a signifi- cant amount of time should be spent in planning how the data will be used in an effort to prevent this. 77",Book 1_2036060.pdf,78,"**Document Stores: Benefits and Drawbacks**
======================================================

**Benefits**

* Quick setup and interaction with the document store
* High retrieval speed

**Drawbacks**

* **Security**: Default deployments are often insecure, especially when remote connections are enabled
	+ Vulnerable installations are rampant due to simplicity of setup
	+ Security concerns are often overlooked in favor of ease of use
* **Performance**: Suboptimal retrieval performance when using fields other than the default `_id` field
	+ Additional indices can be created for other fields, but may negate the performance benefits of using a document store
* **Space Efficiency**: High retrieval speed comes at the cost of increased storage space
	+ No normalization leads to data duplication
	+ Planning and preventive measures are necessary to minimize data duplication

* SQL databases are more complex and require more configuration, leading to better security practices
* Document stores can be configured to resemble SQL databases, negating their performance benefits
* **When to choose a document store**:

	+ When non-standard data retrieval is not required"
"We want to be sure that our documents are being stored in a way that minimizes duplication. If we fail to do this, then changing or deleting a record will either require that many records be examined to be sure that they do not need to be updated, or our data will become inconsistent depending on which document is examined. This can mean that your initial intuition about the structure of your documents might turn out to be exactly wrong. If good planning isn’t done, this can result in either an application that performs poorly or it will require a great deal of rewriting when we later perceive that the document structure isn’t ideal. 78",Book 1_2036060.pdf,79,"Here are the notes on the topic of document structure and data consistency:

**Document Structure and Data Consistency**
==============================================

### Importance of Proper Document Structure
--------------------------------------

* **Minimizing duplication** is crucial to ensure data consistency and ease of updating/deleting records.
* Without proper planning, initial intuition about document structure may prove to be **incorrect**.

### Consequences of Poor Planning
--------------------------------

* **Inconsistent data**: Changing or deleting a record may require examining multiple records to ensure consistency.
* **Poor application performance**: Applications may perform poorly due to inefficient document structure.
* **Rewriting required**: Failure to plan properly may lead to extensive rewriting when the document structure is deemed suboptimal."
"To illustrate these ideas, think about how we might store Data related to Twitter users, followers, and tweets. At first glance, our intuition might be to store a user document that contains the user ID, password, screen name, tweets, followers, and followed. When someone queries our web interface to view the tweets of a user, a single database query is required that returns a single document holding all of the data that we need. Obviously, some of that data is not displayed, for example, the password. However, the entire tweet history is present. We can also tell how many followers there are and how many people this user is following. Think about what would have to happen if the account for an arbitrary user’s followers were deleted. Naïvely, we could simply delete that user as a document out of the collection. But now, what happens when we view a user who was connected to that deleted user? Is that user still a follower? No. They have been deleted. When do we update the follower count? Should we follow every reference for followers and followed when the deletion is processed and update every one of those documents? That sounds very expensive. Perhaps we should only check to see if the followers and followed still exist when any specific user record is retrieved. This does make the initial deletion far less expensive, but we must now attempt to retrieve the user document for every follower and every followed user to check to see if any have been removed! This is also very expensive and is likely far more expensive since we need to do this retrieval every time the user document is retrieved. Since our class isn’t about good document design in document stores, we are not going to try to solve this problem. Our focus is the ability to interact with and query document stores. 79",Book 1_2036060.pdf,80,"Here are the detailed notes in advanced markdown format:

"Interacting with Mongo using the command-line utility is similar to interacting with a SQL database, not quite the same. If you have previous experience with SQL, then you will see things that feel very familiar. However, you will also find that there are some commands that are just gone. Much like using a SQL database, we must first choose which database we would like to interact with. To determine which databases or document stores are available, we can use the command thatshow dbs . As you can see in the slide above, this will give us a list of the databases, or document stores, that are available along with the total utilized space for each. To choose to use one of these, we use the same command that would be used within SQL: use followed by the name of the database that we wish to query. Similar to an SQL database being made up of tables, the Mongo database is made up of collections. To see which collections are available, we can use the show collections command. So far, so good! It might seem that everything that we learned with SQL can be applied here directly, but that is about to change. 80",Book 1_2036060.pdf,81,"Here are the notes on interacting with Mongo using the command-line utility:

**Connecting to a Database**
* Use the `show dbs` command to list available databases (document stores) and their utilized space
* Choose a database to interact with using the `use <database_name>` command, similar to SQL

**Understanding Database Structure**
* A Mongo database is composed of **collections**, similar to SQL tables
* Use the `show collections` command to list available collections in the database

Let me know if you'd like me to clarify or expand on any of these points!"
"To query one of the collections, or to do anything else for that matter, we use an object-oriented convention to both specify what we are looking at and what operation we want to run on it. For example, if we wanted to list all of the records within the gamemodels collection, we would use the following command: db.gamemodels.find() This command indicates that we would like to access the game models collection within the current database and execute the find method on that collection. In this case, we have not specified any search criteria, so the query will return all of the documents found within that collection. If there are more than a handful, then the output will be truncated. If you read the output carefully, you will see that it instructs you to enter the itcommand to continue with the next page of results. Take a moment to look at the data that is returned. Here you can see the structure of the documents that are stored within this collection. The entire row of data, or the document, is returned as a JSON object. JSON objects are structured as key-value objects. This means that for each element within the collection, you will see the name of that element followed by a colon and then a value. Look at the data carefully and find one of the “levels” elements within a document. Notice that following the colon is an opening (or left) square bracket. This indicates that this element is associated with an array of values rather than just one. In a similar way, we might find that an element is associated with yet another key-value element or even a collection of such elements. This is a very basic example of a nested document. 81",Book 1_2036060.pdf,82,"Here are the notes in advanced bullet-point markdown format:

**Querying a Collection**
=========================

* To query a collection, use an object-oriented convention to specify the collection and operation.
* Example: `db.gamemodels.find()` to list all records in the `gamemodels` collection.
	+ **db**: current database
	+ **gamemodels**: collection to access
	+ **find()**: operation to execute on the collection
* If no search criteria are specified, the query returns all documents in the collection.
	+ Output may be truncated if there are many documents.
	+ Use `it` command to continue with the next page of results.

**JSON Objects and Nested Documents**
------------------------------------

* Documents in the collection are returned as **JSON objects**.
* **JSON objects**:
	+ Structured as **key-value objects**.
	+ Each element has a **name** followed by a colon and a **value**.
* **Arrays**:
	+ Indicated by an opening (or left) square bracket.
	+ Associated with an array of values rather than a single value.
* **Nested documents**:
	+ Elements can be associated with another key-value element or a collection of such elements.
	+ Example: ""levels"" element in a document, which is an array of values."
"We can see that the structure of the data is definitely different from that of SQL. What does a slightly more complex query look like? Let’s try one. db.gamemodels.find( {""_id"" : ObjectId(""5c574f5557c2a873c6ff0c89"")} ) This query specifies that we are looking for all documents that have a certain object ID value stored within the _id field. The ObjectId function call found within the query is used because the ID value present here is not simply a static string. In fact, if you were to attempt the same search using that string as the value, you would not find any records. You will find that in some document store databases, the ID values are stored as objects, and in others, they are not. This is not really a matter of which brand of server is used. It has more to do with whether the programmers are using the native library abstractions to interact with the database or if they are generating the data themselves. One of the places where you can find some inconsistency is when a developer is storing an object ID as a part of an array within another document. This is frequently done to simulate SQL relations. However, the developer has chosen to store it as a string rather than an object, which can have some advantages within the code while simultaneously creating some challenges in the database itself. Alternatively, you may find that they are storing these as objects, which simplifies database access while introducing complications into their code. The main thing to know is that IDs may not always have the object wrapper. As a rule of thumb, if you are looking at an integer field that appears to increment or a field that looks like a UUID value, you are almost certainly looking at a database ID column. 82",Book 1_2036060.pdf,83,"Here are the notes on the provided passage in advanced markdown format:

**Data Structure in NoSQL Databases**
=================================================

**Query Structure**
--------------------

* **db.gamemodels.find()**: query structure in NoSQL databases
	+ **{ ""_id"" : ObjectId(""5c574f5557c2a873c6ff0c89"") }**: specifies the query
		- **ObjectId()**: function call to search for a specific object ID value
		- **""_id""**: field in the document that stores the object ID value

**Importance of ObjectId Function**
------------------------------------

* **ObjectId function**: necessary when searching for a specific object ID value
	+ **Why?**: because the ID value is not a static string
	+ **Consequence**: searching with a string instead of ObjectId will not find any records

**Inconsistencies in ID Storage**
----------------------------------

* **Inconsistent storage of ID values**: dependent on the approach used by developers
	+ **Native library abstractions**: IDs stored as objects
	+ **Manual data generation**: IDs stored as strings
	+ **Complications**: in both database and code

**ID Fields Identification**
---------------------------

* **Rule of thumb**: identifying ID fields
	+ **Integer field that increments**: likely an ID column
	+ **UUID value**: likely an ID column"
"If you’d like to specify more than one search criteria, you need to simply include the additional key-value pairs in a separated list within the curly braces. Not only this, but you can also perform comparisons such as less than, greater than, etc. The notation for these can be counter-intuitive. A key to remembering what the structure of these queries look like is to bear in mind that it is always a key and a value. This means that if you would like to do some comparison against a date field, perhaps finding dates that are greater than some other date, you would first specify the key, which is the date field. Following the colon, you would then specify the comparison operator as the next key and the value to which it is being compared as the final value. We will look at an example of this shortly. Another very useful concept to understand is that of a projection . While you will run into this term in various contacts within the documentation, it is always referring to how the data is presented. A good mental picture to use is that of a map. The actual coordinates on the globe of where continents are, islands are, cities are, etc. When you know take that information and put it onto a map, you are creating a projection of that data. Said another way, you are choosing to represent that data in a specific way. There might be a great deal more information that you have related to the locations of places and objects, but not all of those things are visible. Similarly, a Mongo projection retrieves the data that your request and presents it in the way you describe. This could be as simple as selecting which elements within the document should be dis- played to something more complex like an aggregation of some sort. When it comes to exploring these kinds of topics, the documentation becomes absolutely critical. This is the most critical when you are working directly with the command-line interface. When working with some kind of ab- straction layer or library, the Mongo documentation is useful, but the library documentation is most important. Most libraries will provide a variety of mechanisms to simplify aggregation operations. 83",Book 1_2036060.pdf,84,"Here are the notes on the provided passage:

**Querying in MongoDB**
=====================

### Specifying Multiple Search Criteria

* To specify multiple search criteria, include additional key-value pairs in a separated list within curly braces.

### Comparisons
----------

* Use comparison operators (e.g., `<`, `>`) to compare values.
* Structure: `key: { comparison_operator: value }`

**Projections**
-----------

* A projection is how data is presented, similar to mapping coordinates on a globe.
* Retrieve and present data in a specific way, choosing which elements to display.
* Can be as simple as selecting elements or as complex as aggregations.

**Important Concepts**
-------------------

* **Key**: The field being queried or projected.
* **Value**: The value being compared or retrieved.
* **Comparison Operator**: Operators used for comparison (e.g., `<`, `>`).
* **Projection**: How data is presented and retrieved.

**Best Practices**
-----------------

* Consult the MongoDB documentation, especially when working with the command-line interface.
* When using an abstraction layer or library, refer to both the MongoDB and library documentation.
* Libraries often provide mechanisms to simplify aggregation operations."
"An example of a projection is seen on the slide above. Notice that our search or selection criterion is empty. As we have seen before, this means that we want to see all the documents within the collection. However, after the selection criteria, we have included another argument. Within curly- braces, we have listed the names of the fields or elements that we wish to see. Each of these is listed as a key, which is what they truly are within the document and a value of one. Passing this value of one indicates that we wish to see this value in the resulting projection. A field of interest that we have included in our projection is the __v. This field represents the version of the document. This field can be very useful when examining the data to determine how frequently it has been changed. Within a database cluster, it is quite important to track changes across the cluster and ensure that all replicas are correct. The version field is used to accomplish this. A side point that you might find interesting is that the object IDs used within this datastore are generated fields. The first several bytes indicate a timestamp, the next three bytes are a portion of the MAC address of the database server storing the data, two of the bytes represent the process ID of the Mongo process, and the remaining bytes are an incrementing value. This might not be of immediate relevance, but knowing that there is a structure to this field can be useful when doing troubleshooting or trying to identify data that came from the same source or was inserted at the same time. 84",Book 1_2036060.pdf,85,"Here are the notes in advanced bullet-point markdown format:

**Projections in MongoDB**
==========================

* A projection is a way to select specific fields from a document in a MongoDB collection.
* The search or selection criterion can be empty, which means selecting all documents in the collection.
* After the selection criterion, an additional argument can be included, which specifies the fields to include in the projection.
* This argument is enclosed in curly braces and is a list of key-value pairs, where:
	+ Each key is a field name.
	+ Each value is 1, indicating that the field should be included in the projection.

**Fields in a Projection**
-------------------------

* **__v**: The version field, which represents the version of the document.
	+ Useful for tracking changes across a database cluster and ensuring replica consistency.
* **ObjectId**: A generated field that contains structured information, including:
	+ Timestamp (first several bytes).
	+ MAC address of the database server (next three bytes).
	+ Process ID of the Mongo process (two bytes).
	+ Incrementing value (remaining bytes).
	+ Can be useful for troubleshooting and identifying data origins."
"We previously mentioned that you could use comparison operators in your selection criteria. An example of this is pictured above. Note that we still include the name of the field that we wish to perform the comparison against, and this field appears as the key in the selection. The comparison operator, which is usually some abbreviation and includes the $, is contained within curly braces along with the value for comparison. The $can appear unusual, and you might believe that it indicates an internal operation of some sort, but this is not the case. Instead, this $indicates that this will be an interpolated value that is processed at run time rather than a static field or value. You will see this sort of construct again when building aggregations. Also, in this case, you can see that we have specified different values for the projection. In this case, we have requested that the name field and the value field be displayed. Think about that while you look at the results returned. Is there something missing? Is there something extra? The answer to both questions is yes. Notice that even though it was not requested, the ID column is returned. It is always returned unless you explicitly set it to ero in the projection. Additionally, you should notice that there is no name column displayed. Why is this? The simple answer is there is no name field within the data. Even so, it is very interesting that there are no errors generated! If you tried this same kind of thing with a SQL database, you would absolutely have an error. This can be a very interesting feature when our data is not homogeneous. In other words, imagine that a change of database design has happened and some records have a name field while others do not. In a SQL database, this can never happen. All of the rows must be consistent. Within a document store, this is perfectly legal. This allows us to retrieve records regardless of how the design may have changed or which fields are present. Because of this, if the field isn’t present, there is no output for that field, and there is no error. While convenient, this can create some difficult troubleshooting problems. Imagine that when writing a 85",Book 1_2036060.pdf,86,"Here are the notes on the provided passage in advanced bullet-point markdown format:

**Comparison Operators in Selection Criteria**
======================================================

* **Comparison Operators**: used in selection criteria to filter data
	+ Include the field name as the key in the selection criteria
	+ The comparison operator is contained within curly braces along with the value for comparison
	+ The `$` symbol indicates an interpolated value processed at runtime, not a static field or value

**Projection**
--------------

* Specifies the fields to be displayed in the result set
	+ In this example, `name` and `value` fields are requested
	+ **Note**: The `ID` column is always returned unless explicitly set to `0` in the projection
	+ The `name` column is not displayed because it doesn't exist in the data

**Document Store vs. SQL Database**
------------------------------------

* **Document Store**:
	+ Allows for non-homogeneous data (e.g., different fields in different records)
	+ If a field is missing, no output is generated, and no error is raised
	+ Useful for handling changing database designs or inconsistent data
* **SQL Database**:
	+ Requires homogeneous data (e.g., all rows must have the same fields)
	+ Errors are generated if a field is missing or inconsistent

**Troubleshooting Implications**

* The flexible nature of document stores can create difficulties in troubleshooting

"query, you mistype the name of a field. You could end up spending a great deal of time trying to figure out why the field is not being displayed, while the simple reason is that you have misspelled it. 86",Book 1_2036060.pdf,87,"Here are the notes in advanced bullet-point markdown format:

	+ Simple reason: **misspelled field name**
* **Important**: Double-check field names in queries to avoid wasting time and effort."
"Aggregation and Relations If the data stored within the document store represents individual documents with no relations, queries are very simple. In our experience, it is rare to have data that can be represented in this way within most enterprise applications. This means that you will need to run some kind of rela- tional query. How can we do that if this is a non-relational database? A way to get started with an answer to this is the idea of aggregations. If you recall our brief discussion about map-reduce operations, you can think of the aggregation operation as a reduce operation. We are taking a large set of data, or more likely just one field with that data, and we are reducing it down to a single value. Said another way, we are aggregating all of the like values from a certain field and performing some simple operation on these. Considering the example in the slide, we are aggregating all of the value fields found within the individual question model documents. In the aggregation operation, we are asking to group all of these, assigning a new name, totalPoints , which receives the sum of the value fields. The output, as you can see, is the sum of all of those value fields. This is a good start, but it’s not quite a relation. 87",Book 1_2036060.pdf,88,"Here are the notes on Aggregation and Relations in document stores in advanced markdown format:

**Aggregation and Relations in Document Stores**
=====================================================

**When Data Has No Relations**
-----------------------------

* In document stores, data is stored as individual documents with no relations.
* Queries are simple, but this is rare in enterprise applications.

**Aggregation: A Way to Relate Data**
-----------------------------------

* Aggregation is similar to a reduce operation in map-reduce operations.
* It involves taking a large set of data (or a single field) and reducing it to a single value.
* Aggregation groups like values from a certain field and performs a simple operation on them.

**Example: Aggregating Values**
-----------------------------

* In the example, the aggregation operation groups all `value` fields from individual question model documents.
* The resulting aggregate is assigned a new name, `totalPoints`, which is the sum of the `value` fields.

**Limitations of Aggregation**
-----------------------------

* Aggregation is a good start, but it's not quite a full relation.
* More complexity may be needed to establish true relationships between data."
"To accomplish this, we will write a much more complex query. We are still performing an aggre- gation of a sort since we are trying to collect multiple records in some way. The first thing that we pass into the selection or filter position is an $unwind operator. Notice that we are passing it a value of $questions . Where does this value come from? This is the interpreted value of the questions field within the current section model as the query iterates over the collection. Consider the next argument passed. Here we find a $lookup operator. Within this lookup is a relation. We are requesting that the values within questions , which is an array containing the object ID values of the individual question records related to the section model, are used to select those records from the question models collection using the _id field within that foreign collection as the join criteria. Each resulting question that is returned will be placed temporarily into the question variable. The$match argument is being used to identify which section model documents should be used to perform in this join. The final argument generates the projection. In this case, we are asking to see the name the field from the section model along with the value for each question that is connected to this section. 88",Book 1_2036060.pdf,89,"Here are the notes in advanced bullet-point format:

"MongoEngine By no means should the query from the last slide be viewed as unusual or difficult. While many view the SQL language as being challenging and nonintuitive, we think everyone will agree that the query language in mongo is definitely less intuitive, especially attempting to do any kind of join or aggregation! Is there an easier way? We think so. While being able to muddle through at the command-line interface for a database is important, we certainly don’t want to do this every day. Since we are looking to automate as much of our work as we can, it makes sense to spend time looking at ways to create abstractions using our chosen language. MongoEngine is an excellent Python library that provides high-level object-oriented abstractions to the underlying Mongo database. Using MongoEngine, a relation such as what we just performed, can be dramatically simplified. Aggregations are also much more straightforward, and iterating over the data is very simple since we can use list comprehensions and other Python constructs. To make good use of this library, though, we have to have the Python objects that represent the structure of the Mongo database. At first, this might sound insurmountable, but it is not actually that difficult. MongoEngine makes use of a lower-level library called PyMongo. We can use PyMongo directly to interact with the database much as we would from the command line. Using either the command line or PyMongo, we can determine the names of databases, names of collections within databases and retrieve arbitrary documents. We can use these to reconstruct the Python objects. This is much easier than it sounds. 89",Book 1_2036060.pdf,90,"Here are the notes on MongoEngine in advanced bullet-point format:

"PyMongo Let’s work through the beginning of a simple example. Our first task will be to connect to the database. Since we do not yet know the structure of the documents or the names of the collections, we cannot yet use MongoEngine. Therefore, we will begin with PyMongo. After importing the library, we can create an instance of the MongoClient object. The constructor can accept several arguments, but the most important is the location of the database to which we are connecting. If additional credentials are required, these can also be included as arguments. Unfortunately, most Mongo databases tend to be deployed with no authentication required. For this reason, we aren’t going to spend a great deal of time discussing different authentication options here. If your database does require authentication, just refer to the PyMongo documentation to determine how to present the specific type of credentials that you have. Once this has been instantiated, we can begin to interact with it directly. Our first step will almost always be to call the list_database_names() method. The output depicted in the slide is fairly typical. The admin ,config , andlocal databases are all internal to Mongo. That means that the data of interest must be stored in scoreserver . 90",Book 1_2036060.pdf,91,"Here are the notes on the topic of connecting to a MongoDB database using PyMongo:

"Now that we know the name of the database we are interested in, we need to tell the database driver that we want to use it. At the command-line interface, we would use the use <database> command. Here, we simply refer to it as an attribute of the connection object. While this might not be obvious or intuitive, it is definitely easy! In the slide, we capture this reference to the score- server database into a new variable. Now that we have this reference, we can use it to interrogate the database and access collections. In our case, we use the list_collection_names() message to retrieve an array of all of the collections present in this database. 91",Book 1_2036060.pdf,92,"Here are the notes on the topic in advanced bullet-point markdown format:

"You are likely beginning to detect a pattern. First, we determine the names of the databases and then selected one to use. Using that, we determine the names of the collections. Finding a collection of interest, we can now refer to it directly. Here we are capturing a reference to the usermodels collection and accessing it as though it is a key in a dictionary named db. Now that we have a reference to the usermodels collection, we can begin to interact with it. At this point, you can see something that probably looks familiar! Note the find_one() function. This is the same function that we would use at the Mongo command line. In fact, the goal of PyMongo is to give you access to the native functions available within the Mongo database server. 92",Book 1_2036060.pdf,93,"Here are the notes in advanced bullet-point format:

"On the previous slide, we ran a query to find one document out of the user models collection. The slide shows us this record. We can see that the record is in the expected JSON notation, and we can identify the keys and values. We can also see that there are some nested subdocuments or values present. Several of the fields are particularly interesting as examples of things that we have mentioned pre- viously in this section. Specifically, notice the newGameArray key and value(s). This field contains an array. That array appears to contain a dictionary, though it is just another object from a JavaScript point of view. The first field in this dictionary, gameId , contains an object ID value. This is a very obvious indicator that this is a reference field to another collection. This is reinforced by the fact that there is also an _id field that also contains an object ID. Continuing to the next field, we find gameData . This also contains another dictionary. Look carefully at the keys in this dictionary. Do they look familiar? Compare them to the object IDs also found within this document. These are object IDs! However, these do not have the ObjectId() - class wrapping them. Instead, they are bare strings that are being used as dictionary keys. While this is a good start, how can we easily access the status? After all, while we can see this structure, we do not have matching Python objects. Let’s try to solve this. 93",Book 1_2036060.pdf,94,"Here are the notes in advanced bullet-point markdown format:

"From PyMongo to Document Models If we decide that we care about the usermodels collection, we can take the time to reverse engineer a document structure that is close enough to allow us to access this data easily. Don’t be overly concerned about getting it exactly right. It really does not need to be! It simply needs to be close enough for the data types to be acceptable. You also do not have to be overly concerned about generating matching fields for every single element in the data. For example, this document has a somewhat complex structure with several fields containing arrays, collections of sub-documents, or other objects. Rather than trying to define these fully, we can simply designate them as an array. To make this class, which you can think of as a crosswalk mapping, begin by looking at the object returned by the PyMongo call. Begin by identifying all of the top-level field names and consider the values assigned to them to make a rough guess about data types. If you are unsure, a string type can be used to contain almost anything. With this initial examination done, we need only define a class that is a subclass of the MongoEngine Document class. Within the course, we define instance variables with names that match the fields within the Mongo document. 94",Book 1_2036060.pdf,95,"Here are the notes on the topic ""From PyMongo to Document Models"" in advanced bullet-point markdown format:

-----------------------------------------

* Decide which collection to focus on (e.g., `usermodels`)
* Reverse engineer a document structure that is ""close enough"" to access data easily
* Don't worry about getting it exactly right; just aim for acceptable data types

### Defining a Document Model Class
-------------------------------------

* Create a class that is a subclass of `MongoEngine`'s `Document` class
* Define instance variables with names that match the fields within the Mongo document
* Use the object returned by the PyMongo call to identify top-level field names and data types

### Tips and Considerations
---------------------------

* Use an array type to simplify complex structures (e.g., arrays, collections of sub-documents, objects)
* If unsure about a data type, use a string type to contain almost anything
* Focus on getting a rough guess of data types; no need to define every single element in the data"
"Here we have followed the pattern that is described on the previous slide. Looking at the user- model document that was returned, we can see that there is a name field that seems to contain a string. Similarly, there is a password field that also contains a string. The next two fields look more complex. Rather than trying to parse these completely and to de- fine their content precisely, let’s just define them as arrays of strings. The way that we do this within Mongo and, therefore, MongoEngine, is to define them as ListField objects that contain StringField() objects. Next is a rights field that seems to only contain integer values, so we will define that as an integer. The next two fields are the sessionId and the teamId , which both appear to contain ObjectId() values. However, for now, at least, let’s define these as strings. The next field, newGameArray , is also a very complicated set of nested documents. To simplify things, we will define this as an array of strings. The last field that we are going to try to capture is theupdated field, which clearly contains a date, so we will define this as a DateTimeField() . Now that we have a definition of this document, we can use it to access data within the collection. Switching over to the MongoEngine style, we establish a connection to the Mongo server, simulta- neously selecting the scoreserver database as our focus. Once that is done, we can simply ask for the first object in the usermodels collection and extract the name. When we do this, we see that we have successfully retrieved a record, and it has been populated, allowing us to access the name of the first user in the collection. Success! 95",Book 1_2036060.pdf,96,"Here are the notes in advanced bullet-point advanced markdown format:

**MongoEngine and MongoDB Document Definition**
=====================================

### User Model Document
#### Fields:

* **name**: string
* **password**: string
* **complex fields**: arrays of strings (defined as ListField objects containing StringField objects)
* **rights**: integer
* **sessionId**: string (ObjectId value)
* **teamId**: string (ObjectId value)
* **newGameArray**: array of strings (nested documents simplified as an array of strings)
* **updated**: DateTimeField (contains a date)

### Accessing Data with MongoEngine
#### Steps:

1. Establish a connection to the Mongo server and select the scoreserver database.
2. Access the usermodels collection.
3. Retrieve the first object in the collection using MongoEngine.
4. Extract the **name** field from the retrieved object."
"Stand back and think about why we are doing what we are working on now. If we have a collection of data that simply contain strings, we could just query that directly and not worry about creating a matching Python class. While it might be a bit unusual, simple queries with this kind of data are straightforward in Mongo. What if I have document collections that are somehow using relations such as might be present in SQL? In the case where collections are related, and those relations matter to us for data acquisition, it might be well worth our while to generate matching Python classes. This can drastically simplify the use of those relations. Similarly, if the relations are across multiple databases rather than just between collections, we would likely make the same choice. You really need to do a cost-benefit analysis of the effort involved. Ask yourself how difficult the query will be to write using the native query language. Also, ask yourself how many times you were going to need to transform the data. If you find yourself doing it more than one time or needing to create more than one relation, or if that relationship is tricky, the time to create this abstraction is early . On the other hand, if all of the data is within a single collection, or if minimal transformations of the data as stored will be required, then we probably would not want to create this data abstraction. As a rule of thumb, when you find yourself diving into the Mongo documentation to figure out how to run a query, and it is not making intuitive sense to you, you should pause and ask if you should be re-creating this using a document abstraction and Python. 96",Book 1_2036060.pdf,97,"Here are the notes on the provided passage in advanced bullet-point markdown format:

**When to Use Python Classes with MongoDB Data**
==================================================

* **Simple Queries**: If you have a collection of strings, you can query directly without creating a Python class.
* **Related Collections**: If collections are related and those relations matter for data acquisition, generating matching Python classes can simplify the use of those relations.
* **Cost-Benefit Analysis**:
	+ Consider the effort involved in writing native queries and transforming data.
	+ Ask yourself:
		- How difficult is the query to write?
		- How many times will you need to transform the data?
	+ If you need to create multiple relations or complex transformations, create a Python class abstraction early on.
* **Rules of Thumb**:
	+ If data is within a single collection and minimal transformations are required, you likely don't need a Python class abstraction.
	+ If you're struggling to write a query and it doesn't make intuitive sense, consider recreating it using a document abstraction and Python.

Web Scraping Our final section of this book will deal with another very common source of data used by data scientists every day: web scraping! 99,Book 1_2036060.pdf,100,"**Web Scraping Notes**
=======================

* **Definition**: Web scraping is the process of automatically extracting data from websites, which is a common source of data used by data scientists daily.
* **Importance**: Web scraping is a crucial skill for data scientists as it allows them to collect data from websites, which can be used for various purposes such as data analysis, machine learning, and more.

**Key Concepts**
-----------------

* **Web scraping**: The process of automatically extracting data from websites.

**Vocabulary**
---------------

* **Web scraping**: (Noun) The act of automatically extracting data from websites."
"When the topic of web scraping comes up, people most often think about connecting to existing public websites and extracting data from them. This has been such a huge load on some websites, in addition to the outright theft of material, that many websites take steps to make web scraping very difficult. While this is certainly one of the meanings of web scraping, there are many other contexts in which web scraping occurs. Consider your own organization. Are there any internal web applications that are used to create useful dashboards? Is there a date represented on any of these dashboards that might prove to be useful for some sort of statistical analysis or perhaps a machine learning solution? For example, one of our clients uses kinetic uninterruptible power supplies or flywheel UPSes. These devices have a JSON-based API that exposes dozens of metrics about the performance of the UPS. These include things like current, RPM, average RPM, temperature, vacuum pressure, etc. After having several of these devices fail unexpectedly and with no notice, the organization began to harvest all of the data exposed through the API. Once they had collected several months’ worth of data and have observed several other devices fail, they were able to build a correlation model that could be used to predict when the next UPS would fail. The model was so good that it could typically predict the failure of a UPS to within a 30-minute window 72 hours in advance. With this information in hand, our customer was able to convince the vendor to begin quarantine replacements of UPSes that have not yet failed based solely on their predictive model. This is a wonderful example of Data science being used to prevent a security incident from occurring. Availability incidents are not normally the kind of incidents that we think about daily. What does this have to do with web scraping? Remember, the API exposed a JSON interface. This means web scraping was used! 100",Book 1_2036060.pdf,101,"Here are the notes on web scraping in advanced markdown format:

**Web Scraping**
================

### Common Misconception
* Web scraping is often associated with connecting to public websites and extracting data, which can be a huge load on websites and lead to theft of material.

### Other Contexts
* Web scraping also occurs in other contexts, such as internal web applications and APIs.

### Internal Web Applications
* Many organizations use internal web applications to create useful dashboards.
* These dashboards may contain useful data for statistical analysis or machine learning solutions.

### Example: UPS Monitoring
* A client used web scraping to collect data from kinetic uninterruptible power supplies (UPS) with a JSON-based API.
* The API exposed various metrics, including:
	+ Current
	+ RPM
	+ Average RPM
	+ Temperature
	+ Vacuum pressure
* The client collected data for several months and built a correlation model to predict UPS failures.
	+ The model could predict failures within a 30-minute window 72 hours in advance.
	+ This allowed the client to convince the vendor to replace UPSes before they failed.

### Web Scraping in API Context
* The UPS API exposed a JSON interface, which was used for web scraping.
* Web scraping is not limited to public websites, but can also be applied to internal APIs and web applications."
"HTML Basics While we would like to assume that everyone knows how HTML works and what it looks like, that seems like an unsafe assumption for our class. Therefore, if you already have some background in HTML and you are familiar with it, please be patient while we take just a few moments to review the bare-bones basics. HTML is a text-based markup language that was created in the early 1990s. A markup language is simply some kind of notation or symbolic language for annotating or representing the structure of text. You can think of what proofreader marks might look like in typewritten text. Certain marks mean that things should be bold, other marks mean words should be deleted, yet others mean that words should be inserted. In a similar way, HTML provides marks that can be used to indicate how text should be rendered. These marks are referred to as tags. Each tag is contained within angle brackets, or less than and greater than signs. Nearly all of the tags come in pairs. This is convenient because it makes it simple to identify where blocks of related data are. For all the tags that come in pairs, the closing tag is prefixed with a forward slash. An example would be <tag> indicating the beginning of an arbitrary tag and </tag> representing the closing tag. Most tags can take many different arguments that are used for styling using CSS or possibly to make the page more reactive using JavaScript. While we are not particularly concerned about CSS, the CSS identifiers and names can be useful when trying to extract the data. For example, if we are trying to identify the headline text for news articles and we find that the HTML content has a CSS identifier named News headline, that might be the most efficient way to identify and extract the headlines. 101",Book 1_2036060.pdf,102,"Here are the notes on HTML Basics in advanced bullet-point format:

"We are not going to try to provide you with an exhaustive list of HTML tags. There’s really no value in this since we are not trying to generate HTML pages, and our interest in HTML does not extend beyond how we can extract the data out of the HTML page. If you are curious, the W3C maintains the standards and documentation for the official tags supported under the standards. Even this is not complete, however. Every browser we have ever seen will also implement proprietary tags. This started some years ago as browser vendors attempted to establish market dominance by having features that force you to use their browser should sites implement these non-standard or proprietary tags. In the past, any non-standard tags would result in an error message to the user. The creation of proprietary non-standard tags proliferated so widely that the browser vendors have uniformly ceased issuing these warnings. Today, if a browser sees a well-formed tag that it cannot identify, the tag is simply ignored, along with all of the content within it. As an aside, this might mean that there is more information present in the webpage than the web browser is rendering. SPAs1, and other responsive web applications that make use of custom stylesheets and JavaScript libraries rely heavily upon non-standard tags. Since browsers now ignore them, they can be used to safely identify different portions of the application within the DOM, or document object model, that can be changed dynamically by the JavaScript as the user interacts with the application. 1“Single Page Applications” are a form of responsive web application that presents the appearance and responsive- ness of a local desktop application or mobile app while actually being delivered as a web application. Rather than links and buttons causing the browser to navigate to different pages, all of the content is rendered through this single page. 102",Book 1_2036060.pdf,103,"Here are the notes in advanced bullet-point markdown format:

"When most programmers first interact with HTML with the goal of extracting data, they will usually intuit that regular expressions are probably the way to go. While regular expressions are very pow- erful and can easily solve most problems, parsing HTML and, more generally, XML with regular expressions can be exceptionally challenging. As a result, we would strongly dissuade you from attempting to do so. It is far easier to make use of a well-documented library that implements an HTML parser. If we use such a library, it can be quite simple to extract all of the links, for instance. Or to extract all of the image tags. Or perhaps there is an element or two that has a specific CSS class or ID. These libraries make this type of access very easy. Pictured in the slide, we see a basic example of a simple webpage. While not required, most web- pages will begin with a doctype . This defines how this document should be parsed by the browser. Following this, we have an HTML tag. If you look at the bottom of the content, you will find that there is a matching closing tag with the leading forward slash. Between these two tags sit all of the content that will be rendered as the webpage. This idea of opening and closing tags provides a simple way of organizing sections of the document. Notice that the third line of the document begins with the head tag. Can you find the closing tag? It’s located at the end of the fifth line. While developers will typically structure their document using newlines and tabs to indicate semantic structure, there is no requirement to do so. You could, in fact, put the entire content of the webpage on a single line. Many of the elements that we will find within these webpages are of no real interest to us. For example, the icon used in the browser bar, the stylesheet referenced on line five, the JavaScript found on the next to the last line. We are usually concerned with the textual content. 103",Book 1_2036060.pdf,104,"Here are the notes in advanced bullet-point markdown format:

**HTML and Parsing**
=========================

* **Avoid using regular expressions to parse HTML/XML**: it can be exceptionally challenging, and instead, use a well-documented library that implements an HTML parser.
* **Benefits of using an HTML parser library**:
	+ Easy to extract links, image tags, or elements with specific CSS classes/IDs
	+ Simplifies access to webpage elements

**Basic HTML Structure**
-------------------------

* **DOCTYPE declaration**: defines how the document should be parsed by the browser
* **HTML tag**: opens and closes the document, with all content rendered as the webpage
* **Opening and closing tags**: organize sections of the document
* **Example structure**:
	+ `<html>` (opening tag)
	+ `<head>...</head>` (with closing tag on line 5)
	+ `<body>...</body>` (with closing tag at the end)

**HTML Structure Variations**
-----------------------------

* **Optional whitespace and tabbing**: developers often use newlines and tabs to indicate semantic structure, but it's not required
* **Single-line content**: the entire content of the webpage can be put on a single line

**Irrelevant Elements**
----------------------

* **Examples of ignored elements**:
	+ Icon used in the browser bar
	+ Stylesheet referenced on line 5
	+ JavaScript on the next to last line
* **Focus on textual content**: usually the most interesting part of the webpage

"SPAs and Scraping Single-page applications are specifically designed to simulate a desktop-based experience within a web browser. While these applications are wonderful, they can represent a significant challenge if we need to scrape data. The primary reason is that the JavaScript must be navigated in order to get at the data that we need. Consider the simple webpage on the slide. Here we can see the beginning HTML tag, the head containing the title, and the body. The body contains only two things. The first is a non-standard tag, and the second is in reference to the JavaScript source code that should be loaded. Where is the web content? The answer is, this is it. A single page application will set up a very simple document model, in this case just the heading and the body with perhaps one non-standard tag, and then use JavaScript to generate all of the HTML that will be displayed to the user. It is possible for everything required to render the page to be present in the JavaScript, but not all applications will work in this way. More frequently, the application will make queries to the backend and, based on those responses, either display data that has been returned or perhaps even render additional JavaScript it has been delivered, creating new document object model elements. If we are trying to create a web scraping script, it is clear that this creates a problem for us. When we retrieve the URL using Python and then pass the results into the web scraping library to parse the HTML, there might be no data present at all! How can we get at the data that we need? 104",Book 1_2036060.pdf,105,"Here are the notes on Single-page Applications (SPAs) and Scraping:
### **What is a Single-page Application (SPA)?**
* A web application designed to simulate a desktop-based experience within a web browser
### **Structure of a SPA**
* Simple HTML structure with:
	+ **Head**: containing the title
	+ **Body**: containing minimal elements, including:
		- Non-standard tags
		- Reference to JavaScript source code
### **How SPAs work**
* SPAs use JavaScript to generate all the HTML that will be displayed to the user
* Data is retrieved from the backend through queries
* Data is displayed or additional JavaScript is rendered, creating new document object model elements
### **Challenges in Scraping SPAs**
* **Problem**: When retrieving a SPA's URL using Python and parsing the HTML, there may be no data present
* **Reason**: JavaScript is used to generate the HTML, but it's not present in the initial HTML structure
### **Implications for Web Scraping**
* SPAs pose a significant challenge for web scraping scripts, requiring alternative approaches to access the data."
"There are several ways to approach this problem. One of these is the use of the Selenium library. Selenium is a web driver that can be used programmatically. You can think of this mentally as an in-memory browser with no visible browser window. We can interact with this rendered browser pane through our Python script. This means that if we need to allow the DOM to be built and then click on things that have been rendered, Selenium is a very effective way to do that. In our experience, this will always require some tinkering. Obviously, every webpage is different. Significant trial and error are frequently required to make sure that we understand precisely how the page is rendered in our browser and how it is rendered in Selenium. Next, we need to identify reliable ways to identify the elements with which we need to interact with programmatically. The rendering engine used within Selenium is based on chrome. 105",Book 1_2036060.pdf,106,"**Web Scraping with Selenium**

* Every webpage is different, requiring tailored approaches

**Key Considerations**
* Identify reliable ways to identify elements for programmatic interaction
* Rendering engine used within Selenium is based on Chrome (version 105)"
"There might be a better way. Selenium is certainly a straightforward way to address the problem though it can be very heavy-handed. What we mean is that we are now running a web driver to render pages in memory so that we can access them programmatically through Python. That is a lot of work if all we really want to do is extract some data. It also opens us up to the possibility that this more complex approach and solution can end up resulting in unexpected failures if we are trying to build something that will periodically query some sort of web-based data store within our environment in order to populate it into a database or make some continuous predictions. It might be possible to eliminate Selenium and the need to render the webpage. How so? Our goal in using Selenium was to ultimately retrieve the data of interest by allowing the JavaScript to populate the document object model under Selenium, interacting with the page programmatically as needed to further update the DOM until the data of interest is rendered into the DOM. If all we are really trying to do is capture the data that is returned in the API, could we just query the API ourselves? That seems like a reasonable approach. Getting started doing this turns out to be pretty simple. The easiest way to approach it is to simply use a browser with the developer console open. We will use chrome in our discussions since it is ubiquitous. Using the chrome developer console, we can look retrospectively at all queries that have occurred and what the responses were. If I know which data I am trying to extract, I can look through those queries or search them to find the query that resulted in the output that I need. With this done, it is a simple matter to copy the query that was sent and to re-create that in Python. This approach has another huge benefit. If we identify and interrogate the API directly, it is highly likely that the API is returning the data as a JSON object. Certainly, other formats can be used. XML is another format that you might find in enterprise SOAP-based applications. These XML documents can be processed in the same way that our webpages would be, and JSON objects can be digested directly. 106",Book 1_2036060.pdf,107,"Here are the notes in advanced bullet-point markdown format:

"Since Selenium is not ideal, especially in a long-running process that we wish to use to retrieve, parse, and process data out of an API, we are faced with the question, “How are we to eliminate Selenium?” A possible solution is to use the developer console in a web browser to identify the queries of interest and send them directly. This also eliminates the need to parse the web content completely. If we consider Chrome as a possible solution, begin by accessing the site or URL of interest. Perform any necessary authentication and locate the link that leads to the data of interest of the URL of the page that displays the data of interest. With this completed, open the developer tools window. This is typically accomplished with the F12 key. The developer tools can be broken out of the web window, but we have chosen to leave it connected in the screenshot above. In the case we are considering, we are looking at a stock ticker for IBM published by Google. The stock quote is periodically updated automatically by JavaScript code running in the web browser. Using the Network tab in the developer console, we have located one of the query/response pairs that returns the current stock quote inside the response. The appearance of that response, in this case, is not ideal since we are using the Preview option rather than viewing the raw Response. We have only done this to make it easier to see the data in the response. In reality, we would be parsing the returned JSON, or other text, that is returned by the API. Now that we have located one of the requests that returns the data of interest, we could right-click on it and open it in a new window. This allows us to verify that requesting that URL will return the data we wish to scrape. Additionally, it is a useful way of obtaining the complete query required without having to dig through the JavaScript code on the page. Assuming that the result in the new tab contains the data of interest, we can now simply copy the entirety of the request, including any required headers, cookies, or tokens, to our Python code. We can now generate a request and examine the result. This result can then be parsed, as needed, if it is not a JSON result. 107",Book 1_2036060.pdf,108,"Here are the notes in advanced bullet-point markdown format:

BeautifulSoup can ingest any HTML encoded data and represent it as an object tree. This can be used to then search and access any part of the page where the content is within it. This library will not handle the retrieval of the webpage. That is your responsibility. While at first, this might seem like a limitation, it makes this more flexible. It means that this library does not care what the source of your document is. Perhaps it’s a document that you have retrieved from a web server, or perhaps it’s a document that you have retrieved from the file server. The source of the document doesn’t matter. Once you have asked this library to digest the file, you can do lookups based on tags, tag values, or almost any other identifiable attribute within the document. The tree is also exposed via a set of arrays so that you can iterate over different portions of the tree or tags as needed. Do not go too quickly past the support for XML. If you have ever had to do XML parsing, then you are likely familiar with the fact that different people and organizations will represent the same XML data in different ways. At first, this can seem quite surprising since XML is intended to be a way to standardize the representation of data. Unfortunately, the flexibility of the language can lead to some hard choices. This flexibility in representation can make XML parsing very challenging. BeautifulSoup simplifies all of this. 109",Book 1_2036060.pdf,110,"Here are the notes on BeautifulSoup in advanced markdown format:

"To make use of the library we must, of course, import it. The package name is BS4. From this, you can import the BeautifulSoup class. With that done, Parsing the webpage could not be easier. We simply retrieve the webpage content from our source, whether that is a website file or perhaps the page we have built in memory, and then ask BeautifulSoup to instantiate the class with that content. You can now instantly access anything within the content in a large variety of ways. In the slide, you can see that we have retrieved a Wikipedia article. After we have done this, we ask the library to parse the content. Next, we ask for a list of all of the H1tags using find_all() . This accessor method returns an array with all matching tags. To extract the first one, we ask for the item at offset ero. Finally, we ask this to be represented as a string, resulting in the output displayed at the bottom of the slide. 110",Book 1_2036060.pdf,111,"Here are the notes on the topic of using the BeautifulSoup library in Python:

**Importing and Setting Up BeautifulSoup**
* Import the BeautifulSoup library (package name: BS4)
* Import the **BeautifulSoup** class from the BS4 package
* **Parsing a Webpage**

"Let’s make this more practical. Let’s imagine that we want to create some kind of machine learning or other solution to identify phishing emails that we are receiving on our email server. Certainly, we have endpoint protection software and virus scanning software on our mail server; but we’d like to be a bit more proactive and possibly identify new, unknown, but possibly suspect phishing emails before users click on them. After hunting around on the internet, we manage to find a repository containing several hundred examples of phishing emails. We would very much like to obtain a copy of these so that we can do some further processing on them later in our class. The problem is that the emails are spread out on a number of pages on the webserver. There is no easy-to-use download link that has all of the examples in one archive. This is a perfect problem for web scraping. We begin by identifying the URL pattern where the data of interest is found. In our case, everything is found on a page within the archive directory. With a little checking, we determined that archive page one has nothing useful on it. We also determined that the very last page in the archive is page 331. So let’s create a for loop to iterate over the range of pages from 2 through 331. For each of these numbers, we will retrieve the matching archive page from the website. After retrieval, we will process that using BeautifulSoup. Having examined the archive pages in our web browser, we determined that the contents of the phishing emails are all contained within blockquote elements. Further, these elements do not appear to be used anywhere else within the website. This is perfect for us. We now extract all of theblockquote elements as an array. With this array in hand, we can iterate over each one of them, extracting the email content. 111",Book 1_2036060.pdf,112,"Here are the notes in advanced markdown format:
**Phishing Email Identification using Web Scraping**
=============================================

### Problem Statement
* Identify phishing emails on an email server using machine learning or other solutions
* Collect a dataset of phishing emails for further processing

### Solution: Web Scraping
* Find a repository of phishing emails on the internet
* Web scrape the emails from multiple pages on the website

### Web Scraping Process
* Identify the URL pattern of the data of interest
	+ In this case, the data is found in the ""archive"" directory
* Determine the range of pages to scrape
	+ Page 1 has no useful data, and the last page is page 331
	+ Create a `for` loop to iterate over pages 2-331
* Retrieve each archive page using the URL pattern
* Process each page using **BeautifulSoup**

### Extracting Phishing Emails
* Inspect the archive pages to identify the HTML element containing phishing emails
	+ In this case, the phishing emails are contained within **`blockquote` elements**
* Extract all `blockquote` elements as an array
* Iterate over the array to extract the email content

**Key Concepts**

* **Web Scraping**: extracting data from websites using programming languages and tools
* **BeautifulSoup**: a Python library for parsing HTML and XML documents
* **Phishing Emails**: fraudulent emails designed to trick users into revealing sensitive information"
"What if the data that we need is accessible over an API? Perhaps we have decided that using Se- lenium is too much work or not a good decision long-term. In this case, we need to send the web request to whatever the API endpoint URL is and retrieve the result. This seems very simple, but a little bit of care is required. When examining the API call within the developer console of something like Chrome, pay careful attention to the cookies that are being sent. Specifically, we need to identify if there is some sort of authentication token, Session ID, JavaScript web token, or other important element being sent in the request that will be required for our programmatic requests to function. One simple approach to isolating this is to right-click on the request. This will usually give you the option to open it in its own web browser window. Opening the request in a new window can be useful to see if simply re-requesting the data in the same way results in the retrieval of the data of interest. In rare cases, you will find that the request can only be made one time, having some sort of single-use token attached. In this case, we might fall back on Selenium rather than trying to work out how that single page request is keyed. We may also determine that the API call makes use of a POST request. Sending a POST request can seem very challenging, but it turns out to be easy. What we need to do is URL-encode whatever data it is that we need to send. Once we do this, embedding things like cookies and other elements, we can include the encoded data as a second argument to the urlopen() request. This will automatically send a POST request rather than a GET. With this done, we can now extract the resulting JSON object and continue with our processing. 112",Book 1_2036060.pdf,113,"Here are the notes in advanced markdown format:

### API Data Retrieval
#### Key Considerations
* **Authentication tokens**, **Session IDs**, and **JavaScript web tokens** may be required for programmatic requests
* Identify important elements sent in the request using the developer console (e.g. Chrome)

#### Isolating Request Elements
* Right-click on the request to open it in a new window
* See if re-requesting the data in the same way results in retrieving the desired data
* Note: some requests may only be made one time due to single-use tokens

#### Sending POST Requests
* **URL-encode** data to be sent
* Embed cookies and other elements in the encoded data
* Pass the encoded data as a second argument to the `urlopen()` request
* This will send a **POST request** instead of a **GET request**

#### Processing the Response
* Extract the resulting **JSON object**

"Lab 5: Web Scraping It’s time to start our last lab for this book. In this lab, you are going to interact with a Web server using a variety of tools. You will look at doing basic web scraping from simple pages. You will also re-create the extraction of the phishing email content. Further, after extracting this content, you will also learn how to insert that data into a new Mongo database. This turns out to be pretty useful; since we will often be extracting large amounts of data, we need somewhere to store temporarily yet efficiently. While we could use a flat-file1, think about the challenges of trying to decide how to store your phishing emails in some kind of CSV file. Storing it into a database turns out to be much easier. 1A flat-file is essentially just a plain text file. A CSV file is an example of a flat-file. 113",Book 1_2036060.pdf,114,"Here are the notes on Lab 5: Web Scraping in advanced markdown format:

"Conclusion Hopefully, you have enjoyed your experience so far. Undoubtedly, this experience has been quite different from other science classes that you have taken. First of all, the book is quite small! Instead, the majority of your time has been spent working through labs after some basic instruction and demonstrations from your instructor or the pre-recorded content. The key points to take away from today are about the fields of data science in general and our purposes in this applied data science course. All of the techniques and tools that we worked with today will be used throughout the rest of the course. Everything that we do each day builds on the things taught in the previous day. This means that in future labs, we will assume that you know how to interact with a Mongo database, a SQL server, or perform a web query. If you have challenges with any of these things, you should stop and ask your instructor. Make sure that you’ve mastered these topics. It is also important that you have completed all of the labs connected to this book before proceeding into the next book. To that end, our labs included a Python bootstrap to make sure that you have at least enough basic Python knowledge to be successful in the rest of the class. We will use some Python constructs that are a bit more complicated than what was covered in the bootstrap, but those things should be intuitive to pick up based on the progression through the remainder of the material. We also spent time learning a little bit about how to visualize data with matplotlib. While there are many other libraries that are used for rendering graphics, this library is very frequently the underlying library in these other tools. Understanding and being able to use this fluently is an important step in being able to represent our data in meaningful ways that others can gain insight from. Finally, we looked at three different ways that we can acquire data. That could be from SQL Servers, 115",Book 1_2036060.pdf,116,"Here are the notes in advanced bullet-point markdown format:

"Fundamentals of Statistics This volume is possibly one of the more challenging in that it will cover a variety of mathematics concepts that may or may not be familiar to you. Even if you have covered some of these topics, my experience is that students will often provide feedback that the coverage in this material helps to clear up things that they did not understand from college courses that they had passed during their academic career. If nothing else, this material should connect some dots for you. Our first section of this book will focus specifically on statistics. Statistics generally come in two main forms. They can either be used to describe or summarize data, or they can be used to infer things about a population, trends, or other interesting aggregations of data. We will examine both uses of statistics today and will actually continue this examination through the rest of the course, though it may be less apparent that these concepts underlie much of what our machine learning solutions do. While we realize that it is likely that most students have had at least some basic introduction to statistics, we will still take the time to cover these basics and work through some practical exercises related to them. Even if you have a fundamental understanding of statistics, you will likely find that there are some approaches and applications within this material that you may not have been aware of or might not have made based on your existing knowledge. 4",Book 2_2036060.pdf,5,"Here are the notes in advanced bullet-point format:

"Functions Since we will be covering a variety of mathematics topics today and throughout the course, it makes sense for us to lay out some fundamental definitions. One fundamental topic that will come up in virtually every section is that of a function. Within mathematics, a function can be defined as some set of operations performed on an input value that will transform or map the value given as input, for example, x, to some output, y. We say that the set of all possible input values represents the domain of the function. A reasonable name, then, for the resulting set of results is the codomain . There are some other key definitions related to functions that can be quite important. For example, we will frequently be most interested in continuous functions. A simple way to imagine a continuous function is that if we were to use the domain of all real numbers and insert any real number from this domain into the function, there will be a well-defined value in the codomain. Consider for a moment the following function: 𝑓(𝑥) = 1/𝑥 While this function is clearly well defined for almost the entire set of real numbers, what happens if we were to use the value x=0? We might intuitively say that something divided by ero must equal infinity, but there are two problems with this. The first is that the operation of division is undefined with a denominator of ero. So that means that this function is undefined at this value, not that it evaluates to infinity. Even if it could evaluate to infinity, this represents a different problem. First, infinity is not actually a number, but instead a concept. Second, consider another part of the definition for a continuous function. It is not simply defined as a function that has a value at every 5",Book 2_2036060.pdf,6,"Here are the notes on the topic of functions in advanced markdown format:

**Functions**
================

### Definition of a Function

* A function is a set of operations performed on an input value (e.g., **x**) that transforms or maps it to an output value (e.g., **y**).
* The set of all possible input values is called the **domain** of the function.
* The resulting set of output values is called the **codomain**.

### Key Concepts

* **Continuous Function**: A function that has a well-defined value in the codomain for every input value in the domain.
* **Domain**: The set of all possible input values of a function.
* **Codomain**: The set of all possible output values of a function.

### Important Notes

* A function can be undefined at certain input values, as seen in the example: `𝑓(𝑥) = 1/𝑥`.
* Division by zero is undefined in mathematics.
* Infinity is not a number, but a concept.
* A continuous function is not simply defined as a function that has a value at every input value."
"point within the domain, but it also specifies that the values within the codomain cannothaveany abruptchangesinvalue . The example we have chosen here is an excellent example of this. Consider, what is the value if we evaluate this function with a value x=1? Unsurprisingly the answer is one. What happens if we setx=-1 ? In this case, the output of the function is a negative one. So far, so good. What happens asxgets closer to ero? If we evaluate the function at x=0.5 , the output of the function is 2. If we evaluatex=-0.5 , the output is -2. The problem is beginning to emerge. If x=0.001 , then the output is 1000. Ifx=-0.001 the output is -1000. Can you see from these values that the function is divergent, with smaller positive values tending toward higher and higher numbers and smaller negative numbers tending toward higher and higher negative numbers? This means that even if the value x=0could be computed through this function, there would be an enormous change, or an abrupt change, between neighboring values. There is a somewhat related idea that is sometimes confused with the idea of a function being continuous. A function must also be differentiable . In simple terms, this means that at any point along the output of the function, we must be able to determine the slope of the function, or how the value of the output changes with respect to the input. With the function we are considering now, we can determine the slope at almost all points except for one; that is, x=0. We point this out because whether or not a function is differentiable is not the same as whether or not we can calculate the slope at some specific point. This can be important later in our course. 6",Book 2_2036060.pdf,7,"Here are the notes in advanced bullet-point markdown format:

**Function Continuity and Differentiability**
=============================================

### Function Continuity

* A function is **continuous** if its values do not have abrupt changes.
* The example function `f(x) = 1/x` is not continuous at `x = 0` because the output changes drastically as `x` approaches `0`.
* Even if we could compute `f(0)`, there would be an enormous change between neighboring values, violating continuity.

### Function Differentiability

* A function is **differentiable** if its slope can be determined at any point.
* Differentiability is not the same as being able to calculate the slope at a specific point.
* The function `f(x) = 1/x` is not differentiable at `x = 0`, but it is differentiable at almost all other points.
* Whether a function is differentiable is important in later course topics."
"Another important idea that relates to the domains and codomains of functions is whether or not the values are discrete . The simplest way to envision discrete output is to consider a function that is only capable of outputting an integer from any input. In other words, while the domain might be the set of all real numbers, the output will only be within the set of all integers, which is typically represented as a double-stroke capital Z. If we were to graph out such a function, we might expect to see a sort of stair-step in the output. Would such a function be continuous? As a specific example of this, consider the example given on the slide. Here we are using NumPy to calculate the sum of all of the values within an array and then to divide that sum by the length of the array. Finally, the resulting value is cast as an integer. What if the average calculated by the inner portion of this function came out to 5.7… What would the result of integer cast be? It would truncate the decimal portion and return only 5. In fact, for any value fallen between 5 and 6, the answer would be truncated down to 5. In essence, this is a floor operation. Coming back to our question of whether or not this function is continuous, the answer must be no. Why is this? Because even though the function is defined for every point within the domain, the output abruptly jumps from 5 to 6, 6 to 7, and so on. These abrupt jumps represent the very discrete values that we are trying to explain. As a side, think about what the slope of this function would be. Even though the values change, the slope would always be ero. 7",Book 2_2036060.pdf,8,"Here are the notes on the topic of discrete output in functions:
### Discrete Output in Functions
* **Discrete output**: a function that can only output integers from any input
* **Domain**: the set of all real numbers
* **Codomain**: the set of all integers, represented as ℤ
* **Graph**: stair-step pattern in the output
* **Continuous?**: No, because the output abruptly jumps from one integer to the next
* **Reason**: the function is defined for every point in the domain, but the output has abrupt jumps
* **Example**: a function that calculates the average of an array, rounds down to the nearest integer using integer casting
	+ If the average is 5.7, the result would be 5
	+ This is a **floor operation**
* **Slope**: would always be 0, even though the values change"
"Categorical Data Within the field of statistics, we work with data that is both continuous andcategorical . The idea of continuous data is exactly the same as the concept of a continuous function; for every member of the domain, there is a corresponding member in the codomain with no abrupt changes. Similarly, categorical data would be the same as discrete values. We will work with both kinds of data when applying the statistics. Both forms are equally common. As an example of a categorical problem, we can expand on the previous average function. In the slide, we have some simple Python code that will take an array of 10 exam scores and return a letter grade based on the average. One of the things that will come up later in the class is the problem of how we can take categorical data and represent it numerically. While many people struggle with this, it is something that we do quite intuitively in many areas of our lives. For example, if you see the letter grade “A”, what do you think? Likely, you translate this in your head to a numeric score between 90 and 100. We aren’t going to expand on this now, but bear this in mind as we go through later portions of the course. 8",Book 2_2036060.pdf,9,"Here are the notes on categorical data in advanced bullet-point markdown format:

**Types of Data in Statistics**
=====================================

* **Continuous Data**: similar to a continuous function, where every value in the domain has a corresponding value in the codomain with no abrupt changes
* **Categorical Data**: similar to discrete values, representing distinct categories or groups

**Example of Categorical Data**
---------------------------

* Average function example: taking an array of 10 exam scores and returning a letter grade based on the average
* **Categorical Problem**: representing categorical data numerically (e.g., translating letter grades to numeric scores)

**Challenges and Intuitions**
---------------------------

* Many people struggle to represent categorical data numerically
* However, we often do this intuitively in our daily lives (e.g., translating a letter grade ""A"" to a numeric score between 90 and 100)

**Future Topics**
--------------

* We will revisit the problem of representing categorical data numerically later in the course"
"Statistics Functions We would like to introduce you to and formalize several common statistic functions that we will use in a variety of ways. We will attempt to apply all of these in the hands-on section that is coming up. While our current applications may not be amazing, please realize that we are also laying important groundwork these since functions are critical to the functioning of many of our more advanced machine learning algorithms that are covered later. Mean A statisticalmean is more commonly known by the term average. Ponder the concept behind us for a moment. While you likely know how to calculate an average already, consider what it is meant to represent; it is a description of the typical value for some set of data. Another way of saying this is that we are trying to determine the “normal” value. Just in case you don’t know how to calculate an average, let’s describe the process. You simply sum all of the values given and then divide by the number of values that you have. We would also like to take this opportunity to begin introducing some more formal mathematics notation. As we do so, we should explain why we are choosing to use this. A major thrust of this class is to demystify much of how machine learning works. This means that we will be working to take complex mathematics concepts and explain them in simple, familiar terms. However, another goal is to prepare you so that should you wish to further investigate the field of machine learning, you are at least somewhat familiar with the notation that you will find in the various papers and documentation that define this field. Mathematics notation can seem to be very opaque, but the entire idea behind it is to simplify the representation of complex ideas into a common set of simple symbols. That might sound counterintuitive since the notation seems so strange, but you should 9",Book 2_2036060.pdf,10,"Here are the notes on Statistics Functions in advanced markdown format:

"find that reading these equations becomes easier and easier as the class goes on. The typical formula that you would find in a statistics textbook for calculating the mean would be: ̄ 𝑥 = 1/𝑛𝑛 ∑ 𝑛=1𝑥𝑖 Note that when programming in the majority of languages, we would iterate over the range from i=0 toi=n-1 . This is slightly different than what you see immediately above. It’s not a big difference, but it’s something to be mindful of since we typically use arrays in which indexing begins at ero. While this function is no doubt very familiar, you might not immediately realize that this statistic is not a very good measure. One of the problems with it is that it is very strongly influenced by outliers . If you ever heard about students in college talking about someone who had “break the curve” they were dealing with exactly this problem. Outliers are values that are much much higher or much much lower than the typical values in the data. But how can we know that this is the case if the mean, our most familiar tool for measuring the typical, is biased by this problem? We need more tools! 10",Book 2_2036060.pdf,11,"Here are the notes on the topic of calculating the mean in statistics:

**Calculating the Mean**
==========================

**Formula**: ̄x = 1/n ∑ xi (i=1 to n)

**Important Notes**:

* When programming, iterate over `i=0` to `n-1` (not `i=1` to `n`)
* **Arrays typically have indexing starting at 0**

**Limitations of the Mean**:

* **Sensitive to outliers** (values much higher or lower than typical values)
* Can be **biased** by outliers (e.g., ""break the curve"" problem)
* Need more tools to measure the typical value in data

Let me know if you'd like me to clarify or expand on any of these points!"
"Weighted Mean One such additional tool is the weightedmean . Imagine a problem where we are trying to determine the average number of logon failures per user. This problem is easy. What if we wanted to work out the average number of logon failures per site? If we know how many logon failures happened in total, we can also sum the total number of employ- ees and find an average of 1.01 failures per user. Will this tell us average failures per site? Clearly not. If we multiply 100 employees by 1.01, we get 101 failures, which is nothing like 32. If we try this with the last site, which has an average of 35.5 failures, this is nowhere near the reported value of 90. These numbers are mildly interesting, but what are the actual number of average failures per site? Given the data in the slide, if we were to calculate the average number of logon failures across the enterprise, we would find that the average is 64.25 (that is, (32 + 60 + 75 + 90)/4 ). Is this number truly representative of what’s happening within the organization, though? It turns out that the answer is no. In fact, if you look at the data, it is clear that this average has been skewed! The first site with 100 employees has only 32 logon failures, while the last site with only 35 employees has 90 failures! A much better measure in this case would be a weighted mean. To calculate the weighted average, we take the number of logon failures at each site and multiply that number by the number of employ- ees. In other words, the number 32 will be counted 100 times, the number 60 will be counted 42 times, and so on. We can sum all of these values and then divide it by the total number of employees across all sites. This gives us a substantially different average. How is this useful? Certainly, we can see that the original average was skewed, but so what? The number that we have just worked out tells us what the average number of failures are when the 11",Book 2_2036060.pdf,12,"Here are the notes on the topic of Weighted Mean in advanced markdown format:

**Weighted Mean**
================

### Problem with Simple Average

* Calculating average number of logon failures per site is not straightforward
* Simple average can be misleading (e.g., 64.25 in the example)

### Weighted Mean

* A better measure that takes into account the number of employees at each site
* Calculated by multiplying the number of logon failures at each site by the number of employees
* Then, sum all the values and divide by the total number of employees across all sites
* Gives a more representative average

### Example

* Original data:
	+ Site 1: 32 logon failures, 100 employees
	+ Site 2: 60 logon failures, 42 employees
	+ Site 3: 75 logon failures, 50 employees
	+ Site 4: 90 logon failures, 35 employees
* Weighted mean calculation:
	+ (32 x 100) + (60 x 42) + (75 x 50) + (90 x 35) = ?
	+ Divide by total number of employees across all sites

### Importance of Weighted Mean

* Provides a more accurate representation of the average number of logon failures per site
* Helpful in seeing the actual trend or pattern in the data"
"weighting of the number of employees is taken into consideration. Consider the second site with 60 logon failures for 42 employees. In the light of the first average, 64.25, the site appears to be below the average and as a result would likely be considered to be much better than the remaining two sites. However, when we use this weighted average, we determine that all of the sites except the first one are well above the average. This approach can help us draw attention to where problems may exist in a less biased way. 12",Book 2_2036060.pdf,13,"**Weighted Average vs. Unweighted Average**

**Calculating Logon Failures**

**Example: Second Site**

* 60 logon failures for 42 employees
* **Unweighted average**: below average (64.25)
* **Weighted average**: above average

**Advantages of Weighted Average**

* Helps to **reduce bias** in evaluating site performance
* Identifies potential problems in a more **objective** way"
"Trimmed Mean Another approach to limiting the impact of outliers on a mean is the idea of a trimmedmean . Re- member that idea of someone “breaking the curve”? What if we were to actively exclude outliers? Could this help to bring the remaining values toward some central common value? This is definitely a valuable approach. What we need to work out is how many values will be trimmed. It is easy to, perhaps, look at the data and see what appears to be an outlier and choose to drop it. However, if we did so, we would be introducing some additional skew. Looking at the data in the slide, the value of 4000 is clearly an outlier. But if we simply drop that value, aren’t we artificially skewing the data lower? Yes! To adjust for this, we cannot simply drop the highest outlier. We must also drop the lowest value, evenifitdoesn’tappeartobeanoutlier . Extending this idea, it means that we need to determine how many values we will trim and then trim the same number of values from both the high data and the low data. The more data that we trim off, the more resistant the result is to outliers. Consider the example that we have in the slide. In this case, we are looking at the average downtime in seconds. If we use all of the values, we arrive at an average downtime of nearly 464 seconds. That is quite a long time. If we use this as a threshold to measure something that is acceptable or unacceptable in terms of downtime, we would be accepting more than six minutes as acceptable. What happens when we trim off the highest and lowest value? The trimmed mean drops by over an order of magnitude! We can see that a much more typical value, or a better average, is about 24 1/2 seconds. This is clearly quite different. 13",Book 2_2036060.pdf,14,"Here are the notes in advanced bullet-point markdown format:

**Trimmed Mean**
================

* **Definition**: An approach to limiting the impact of outliers on a mean by actively excluding outliers.
* **Methodology**:
	+ Trim the same number of values from both high and low data to avoid skewing the data.
	+ Determine the number of values to trim and exclude them from the calculation.
* **Effectiveness**:
	+ The more data trimmed, the more resistant the result is to outliers.
* **Example**:
	+ Average downtime in seconds: 464 seconds (using all values)
	+ Trimmed mean: 24.5 seconds (after trimming highest and lowest value)
	+ **Result**: A much more typical value, or better average, is obtained by trimming outliers.

**Key Concepts**
-----------------

* **Outliers**: Values that are significantly higher or lower than the rest of the data.
* **Skew**: The distortion of data when outliers are not excluded."
"Median Yet another useful value that is highly resistant to outliers is the median value. Median literally means middle. By definition, this indicates that exactly 1/2 of our data lies below this value and 1/2 lies above. To be clear, we are not looking to see which value is calculated to lie at the center point between the lowest value and the highest value (which would be a sort of mean); we are asking which value in our data is in the center. This means that if we had a list of five values that were sorted into either ascending or descending order, the value in the third position, regardless of its value, would be the median. For example, if we had the values 5,4,3,2,1 , the median value is 3. This works fine when we have an odd number of elements in our data. What do we do if we have an even number of elements? There is no central element. The answer is that we take the average of the two most central elements. This average could turn out to be the same as those two elements, but it might also turn out to be a value that does not appear anywhere else in the data. For example, in the list1,1,3,3,6,6 the median value is 3. Why? We have an even number of values, so we need to take the mean of the two most central values. Conveniently, (3+3)/2=3 . However, in the list 1,2,3,4,5,6 , the two central values or 3,4, so the median would be 3.5. 14",Book 2_2036060.pdf,15,"Here are the notes on Median in advanced bullet-point format:

### Definition

* The median value is the middle value in a dataset, where exactly 1/2 of the data lies below and 1/2 lies above.

We’ll see how well these tools work to identify the central tendencies of some real-world data. This should give us a good feel for how these tools can limit the impact of outliers on our analysis. 15",Book 2_2036060.pdf,16,"Here are the notes on Lab 1: Median and Means in advanced bullet-point markdown format:

"Variance So far, we’ve seen some useful tools and possibly added some new tools to your analysis toolbox. One of the most powerful of these is the trimmed mean. The idea behind it is simple enough, but there is definitely a challenge. If we are handling few enough values that we can simply look at them, it is likely easy to determine visually whether or not there are outliers present and decide how many values to exclude. But what if we are looking at 1000 values? How about 1 million values? Or 10 million values? It could be far more challenging to determine what value should be used to calculate a trimmed mean. For this reason, we need some additional tools. More specifically, we need tools that can tell us how much our data varies. If we can work out how much the data varies, we might be able to come up with tools that can be used to determine where thresholds would be that delineate outliers, or what thresholds should be used. To provide you a mental picture of this, think about the question in the slide. If you are presented with the fact that the mean for a certain data is set is 50, how normal is the value 51? Our initial reaction might be that it looks very normal. However, we lack context. What if the range of values found in our data set ran from 49.5 to 51. The average of millions of values in this range works out to be 50. In fact, 51 is very likely an outlier since it is substantially higher than the average in this context, and it is significantly further away from the average than the lowest value. What kind of measures can we use to add context without examining every piece of data? 16",Book 2_2036060.pdf,17,"Here are the notes in advanced bullet-point markdown format:
### Variance
* **Variance**: A measure of how much data varies, essential for determining outliers and thresholds.
### Trimmed Mean

### Understanding Data Variation
* **Importance of Context**: Having a single data point (e.g., 51) without context (e.g., range of values) can be misleading.

"Let’s create a concrete example for us to work with. In the slide, we have provided a list of values that represent downtime in seconds. In this list, the lowest value is 0.5 and the highest is 437.85. When we calculate the average for all of these values, we arrive at a value of just over 50 seconds. Within the data set, you can see that there is what value of 51. How unusual is this value? The example we are presenting here is somewhat different from the example in the last slide. In the previous example, 51 turned out to be an outlier because it was at the high extreme of all of the values measured. In this example, it is not the high extreme. In fact, there is another value that is significantly higher. Even so, examining the values visually, we can likely intuit that 51 is not typical of this data. This is true even though it is so close to the arithmetic mean. Is there a more formal way of recognizing just how unusual this value is? 17",Book 2_2036060.pdf,18,"Here are the notes in advanced bullet-point markdown format:

### Unusual Value: 51

* 51 is not an outlier due to being at the high extreme
* However, visually, 51 appears not typical of the data
* Question: Is there a more formal way to recognize how unusual 51 is, despite being close to the arithmetic mean?

Note: These notes summarize the key points from the passage, highlighting the important information about the downtime values, their range, and the unusual value of 51."
"We already have tools in our toolbox that can be used to solve this problem. Certainly, a trimmed mean where we drop the highest and lowest value will immediately cause 51 to seem exceptionally high. Trimming off more than the highest and lowest value completely eliminates 51 from our data. That will make it seem even more extreme. While this approach works, recall that we are concerned with creating a reproducible approach that will not require us to manually inspect all of the data to determine what threshold should be used. As we continue through this course, we will be looking at datasets that have thousands, tens of thousands, and even millions of data samples. We must have tools that are robust , that is, resistant to outliers, and that can be used with any amount of data. Said another way, we are interested in generalizing our solutions. This idea of generalizing is a very common idea at the heart of mathematics research. Rarely are we interested in the specific case, but we are much more interested in the general case. While we may often start with a specific case or outcome, we typically want to generalize this to find some law. Consider the example of performing calculations in a two-dimensional Cartesian plane. We can work out functions that allow us to do translations, rotations, scaling, and more. These are certainly interesting, but it would be far more valuable to work out a general form for handling translations in n-dimensions. This is not dissimilar to what programmers do. Programmers working on a project are usually focused on solving the specific problem before them. However, wise programmers look at the specific problem and can intuit when a more general solution would be preferable. This idea of generalizing the solution can be seen within object-oriented programming and other common code reuse paradigms. It is one of the ideas behind software design patterns. While our course will usually focus on the specific applications and be less concerned with the pure mathematics behind it, there are times that we will be interested in generalizing our intuitions into 18",Book 2_2036060.pdf,19,"Here are the notes in advanced bullet-point markdown format:

"An exceptionally useful measure that falls into this category is the idea of the variance . To calculate the variance, we begin by taking the sum of the squares of the differences of all of the values of x and the mean of our data. This value is then divided by 𝑛−1 . 𝜎2=∑𝑛 𝑖=1(𝑥𝑖− ̄ 𝑥)2 𝑛−1 Look at this formula carefully1. At first glance, it might appear that we are calculating an average. In fact, we are not. If we were to divide this sum by n, this would be calculating an average of the squared differences between our data and the arithmetic mean. Using an n-1modifies this, creating a slightly more robust value. Even so, it is not useful to think of this as a value that we try to translate into the context of our data somehow. Instead, this gives us an arbitrary measurement of the variance. Using the data that we have examined so far, we know that the mean is 50 and the variance is nearly 17,000. All that we know is that the variance is arbitrarily large. 1By convention, the term 𝜎2in this equation is typically used to represent the variance. 20",Book 2_2036060.pdf,21,"Here are the notes on the topic of variance in advanced bullet-point markdown format:

* **Arbitrary measurement**: variance is an arbitrary value that doesn't translate directly to the context of the data

"Standard Deviation The variance is an interesting measure. We will run into other measures that look very similar and are derived from the idea of the variance later when working with lossfunctions in machine learning. (Loss functions are arbitrary measures of how wrong a guess or prediction is.) A far more frequently used measure that is derived from the variance is the standarddeviation1. In fact, if we have come as far as calculating the variance, only one additional step is required. We need to simply take the square root of the variance to determine the standard deviation. In the case we have been considering in the slide, we have now added the standard deviation cal- culation into our output. You can see that the numpy library includes functions for the average (or mean), the variance, and the standard deviation. Other functions are available as well. We will make use of it some of these in the upcoming lab. In the case we are considering, we find that the standard deviation in this data is 130.12. What exactly does this mean? 1While not pictured on the slide, please note that the symbol 𝜎is typically used in statistics to represent the standard deviation. This makes sense since the standard deviation is the square root of the variance, which is denoted as 𝜎2. 21",Book 2_2036060.pdf,22,"**Statistics and Data Analysis**

"Deriving the standard deviation is not necessarily intuitive. Certainly, calculating the sum of the squares of the differences is somewhat intuitive. Taking the average of these is also fairly intuitive. But why would we take the near average using n-1? Further, why would we then take the square root. The square root will translate the variance into the same scale as our data set. This proves to be very useful. Looking at the data that we have right now, we find that the mean is 50 and a standard deviation is about 130. This means that the majority of our values should fall within a range of about 130 from 50. This turns out to be true, but there’s something wrong. When we do this, we find that all but one value in our data set falls within that standard deviation. This tends to imply that there is something still wrong with our data. Our data must have outliers for the standard deviation to behave in this way. In comparison with the data itself, the standard deviation is very wide. Is it possible for us to trim the data just as we had with a trimmed mean? Absolutely. Trimming the data would allow us to calculate the trimmedstandarddeviation . Just as with the trimmed mean, this would be far more resistant to your outliers, or a more robust measure. 22",Book 2_2036060.pdf,23,"Here are the notes on deriving the standard deviation in advanced bullet-point markdown format:

* But why use `n-1` instead of `n` when calculating the average?
* Why take the square root of the variance?

* Calculating the trimmed standard deviation makes it more **robust** to outliers"
"Let’s take a minute to visualize this idea of the trimmed standard deviation. In the code above, we can see our original data being assigned as a sorted array into the downtime variable. When plotting these values, we are going to choose to trim the data, removing one value from both the top and the bottom. We don’t yet have an algorithmic way to determine how much to trim our data by, but we are coming to that. The plot of the trimmed data is the blue line, or if you were looking at this in black-and-white, it is the line with the points on it. The trimmed mean is indicated by the lack line, or the lower horizontal line in black-and-white. Finally, the trimmed standard deviation is the higher horizontal line. Trimming away the highest and lowest value significantly reduces the average to just below 10. It also dramatically reduces the standard deviation to something around 18. Having made this change, nearly all of the points still fall within one standard deviation, which still implies that there are significant outliers, but the point at 51 is now many standard deviations away from the average. This is a huge change. Previously, this value would have fallen within one standard deviation since it was so close to the arithmetic mean. 23",Book 2_2036060.pdf,24,"Here are the notes in advanced bullet-point format:

"There is definitely something that we can take away from all of this. A relatively large variance will result in a large standard deviation. A large standard deviation tends to indicate that the data is highly variable. This could be totally normal and does not indicate that there are necessarily large outliers. However, when we compare the width of our standard deviation to how our data clusters, we can find strong indications of outliers. For example, if we had highly variable data with a relatively large standard deviation, we might find that 40% or 50% of our data points fall within one standard deviation of the average. On the other hand, if we were to introduce significantly large outliers to this data, this might change and produce a standard deviation where 99% of our data is within one standard deviation. In other words, it is not just that our standard deviation is wide or broad, but that it is wide relative to how our data clusters. This implies that the percentage of data that falls within one standard deviation can be an indicator of significant outliers. At this point, we should have a firm grasp of what the problem is that for trying to solve. Let’s see how we can make this better. 24",Book 2_2036060.pdf,25,"**Standard Deviation and Outliers**

"Median Absolute Deviation A measure that is far more robust but that you are far less likely to have worked with in the past is themedianabsolutedeviation . Just as the median is strongly resistant to outliers, the median absolute deviation is similarly strongly resistant to outliers. Now that we point this measure out, it likely the seems fairly intuitive that measuring the deviation based on the median should be more robust. However, as with many things, this only seems obvious after someone points out that such a measure can be taken. We rarely find that students, even students who have taken a basic statistics course, are familiar with the idea of the median absolute deviation. It seems that coverage of this in fundamental statistics courses is inconsistent. The calculation of this measure is significantly different from the approach that we use for the standard deviation. The first step is to determine the median for your data set. Once you have found this value, subtract this median from each value in your data set and take the absolute value. Store each of these absolute values into a new array. Finally, find the median of the resulting array. Putting this into one sentence, we are determining the median of the magnitude of the differences. 25",Book 2_2036060.pdf,26,"Here are the notes on Median Absolute Deviation in advanced bullet-point markdown format:

* The median of the magnitude of the differences is the Median Absolute Deviation

#### Key Features
* **Robust to outliers**: similar to the median, the Median Absolute Deviation is resistant to the influence of outliers
* **Different calculation approach**: compared to standard deviation, the Median Absolute Deviation has a distinct calculation method

I hope these notes are helpful! Let me know if you have any further requests."
"The numpy library does not have a median absolute deviation function built-in. However, there is another library called statsmodels that includes a variety of robust measures. One of these measures is the median absolute deviation. While creating our own implementation would not be difficult, it is very convenient to simply use this function instead. In the slide, you can see that we are expanding on our starting point. We still have our original data, which we calculate the standard deviation for using all data. We then trim the highest and lowest value to produce the trimmed standard deviation. Next, we take the median value from our complete data set. As you can see, this value is calculated as an average of two data points since we have an even number of data points. Finally, we use the median absolute deviation function from thestatsmodels library to produce a value based on the entire set of data points. Consider the output. Our standard deviation is 130. In the context of our data, quite large. The trimmed standard devi- ation is a substantial improvement, bringing us down to 16. The median value, however, is 1.45. While these values don’t mean that there is definitely one or more strong outliers, seeing such a small median with a relatively larger trimmed standard deviation does imply that this is likely true. However, look at our median absolute deviation: 0.92. If you recall, we began this section by looking at this data and asking how unusual the number 51 was. Seeing that our median absolute deviation is 0.92 with a median of 1.45, we can say that 51 is definitely very unusual for this data set! 26",Book 2_2036060.pdf,27,"Here are the notes in advanced bullet-point format:

### Measuring Data Dispersion
#### Using Numpy and Statsmodels Libraries

* **Numpy library**: Does not have a built-in median absolute deviation function.
* **Statsmodels library**: Includes robust measures, including median absolute deviation.

### Calculating Dispersion Measures
#### Original Data and Trimmed Standard Deviation

* Calculate **standard deviation** using all data.
* Trim highest and lowest values to produce **trimmed standard deviation**.

### Median and Median Absolute Deviation
#### Calculating Median and MAD

"Let’s see what this looks like. Our data set with the highest and lowest value trimmed off is pictured in the slide. The dotted line at 16 is the trimmed standard deviation. The horizontal line that closely follows the first four values in our data set is the median absolute deviation. Visually, we can see that 51 is definitely an outlier. Why do we care about this? Later in the course, we are going to be interested in finding anomalies. Anomalies could be interesting to find as an indicator of malicious activity. An outlier could fall into this category. However, there is a more common reason that we are interested in identifying outliers in our data. One of our goals and using data science should be to make decisions based on the information that we produce from our data. Too often, we as humans are moved to make decisions based on the outliers rather than based on what the data is really telling us. Taking the data that we have and using robust measures on it, we can use statistical methods that are far less susceptible to human bias to identify when something is an outlier. In other words, one or two bad experiences can be rationally ignored in the face of predominant data that demonstrates that those experiences were outliers. 27",Book 2_2036060.pdf,28,"Here are the notes on the provided passage in advanced bullet-point markdown format:

### Importance of Identifying Outliers
* Outliers can be indicators of malicious activity (anomalies)

* Allows for rational ignoring of one or two unusual experiences in the face of predominant data trends"
"Lab 2: Measuring Deviations We are going to examine this idea in the following lab. We have obtained a copy of the data that BackBlaze releases each year. BackBlaze, for our purposes, is a large-scale cloud-based data storage company. The dataset that they release has information about all of the major hard drive manufac- turers, the different drives that they sell, and failure rates within BackBlaze. As you can imagine, it would be very easy to make a decision to never buy a certain brand of drive if you had one drive fail that had really critical information on it. But that decision could fly in the face of what our data is actually saying. Let’s take some time to use the tools that we have developed to analyze this data and see how we could use it to make decisions for data storage choices in our enterprise. 28",Book 2_2036060.pdf,29,"Here are the notes on Lab 2: Measuring Deviations in advanced markdown format:

=============================

### Overview
* Examining the concept of measuring deviations using a dataset from BackBlaze, a large-scale cloud-based data storage company.

### BackBlaze Dataset
* Contains information about:
	+ Major hard drive manufacturers
	+ Different drives sold by each manufacturer
	+ Failure rates within BackBlaze

### Objective
* Analyze the dataset to make informed decisions for data storage choices in an enterprise.
* Avoid making decisions based on personal experiences (e.g., one failed drive) and instead use data to guide decisions.

"Applying Statistics Now that we’ve learned a little bit about some common statistics tools for analysis that can be used to describe our data, we would like to look at some other ways that we can leverage these tools and add in a few more that can provide alternative ways to think about our data. 29",Book 2_2036060.pdf,30,"**Applying Statistics**

### **Descriptive Statistics**

### **Goals**

* Leverage statistical tools for data analysis
* Explore additional tools for data description"
"Histograms One of the tools that you might remember from any statistics course that you have taken is the histogram . A histogram is a tool that allows us to visualize the frequency with which data occurs. Most often, it is rendered as a bar chart where the horizontal x-axis represents the values being considered and the vertical y-axis represents the number of things found in each bin. An example of this is pictured on the slide. On the left, we show a range of values between ero and 1,000 on the x-axis. The y-axis represents how frequently each of those thousand values appears. The histogram to the right shows a frequency analysis of this data. The notion of a binis an important one. The naïve generation of a histogram will render a bar representing the frequency of every unique value that appears in the data. For example, if we are generating a histogram to visualize the words in use in a document, we might generate a column for each unique word. This means that “the”, “a”, and “an” would all have separate columns. So would the words “correct”, “correcting”, “corrected”, and “correctly.” While some words (articles) would needlessly dominate the histogram, others might be underrepresented. How so? Could it make more sense to identify the root word, “correct”, and to put all words using this root into one grouping? This grouping would be a bin. Taking this approach would allow us to see more clearly how frequently the root concept of the word, rather than the word itself, is. This idea need not be limited to grouping by similarity. A common technique when dealing with a large range of values is to arbitrarily bin the data by smaller ranges. When we take this approach, we typically define a binsize , orbinwidth . Alternatively, we might determine how many bins we would like to see and then work out the bin size from that. 30",Book 2_2036060.pdf,31,"Here are the notes on Histograms in advanced markdown format:
**Histograms**
================

### Definition
* A tool to visualize the frequency of data occurrences
* Typically rendered as a bar chart:
	+ Horizontal **x-axis**: represents the values being considered
	+ Vertical **y-axis**: represents the number of things found in each **bin**

### Example
* Range of values between 0 and 1,000 on the x-axis
* y-axis represents the frequency of each value

### Important Concepts
* **Bin**: a grouping of values to facilitate analysis
* **Bin size** or **bin width**: the range of values in each bin
* **Naïve generation**: generating a histogram with a separate column for each unique value, which can lead to:
	+ Overrepresentation of common words (e.g., articles like ""the"", ""a"", ""an"")
	+ Underrepresentation of less common words

### Techniques
* **Root word grouping**: grouping words by their root concept (e.g., ""correct"", ""correcting"", ""corrected"", ""correctly"" grouped together)
* **Arbitrary binning**: dividing a large range of values into smaller ranges (bins) to facilitate analysis
* **Defining bins**: determining the number of bins and calculating the bin size from that"
"Bin Size You can see an example of different bin sizes being applied to the data in the slide above. Note that each of these histograms is depicting the same data. In each case, we have automatically generated different numbers of bins. The first histogram, for example, uses 8 bins. This means that of the range of values were from 1 to 100, each bin would account for a range of 10 values. When generating a histogram, there is a tradeoff. It might seem that more bins must be better, and it can be, but choosing to depict more bins will typically result in the graphing process taking more and more time. 31",Book 2_2036060.pdf,32,"Here are the notes in advanced bullet-point format:

**Bin Size and Histograms**
===========================

* **Bin Size**: The number of bins used to divide the range of values in a histogram.
* **Effect on Histogram**:
	+ **Fewer bins**: Each bin accounts for a larger range of values.
	+ **More bins**: Each bin accounts for a smaller range of values.
* **Tradeoff**:
	+ **More bins**: May provide a more detailed view of the data, but can result in a longer graphing process.
	+ **Fewer bins**: Faster graphing process, but may lose detail in the data.
* **Example**:
	+ First histogram: 8 bins, each accounting for a range of 10 values (from 1 to 100).
	+ Each histogram depicts the same data, just with a different number of bins.

Note: These notes summarize the key concepts related to bin size and histograms, highlighting the tradeoff between the number of bins and the graphing process."
"How do you know if you should use many bins or few bins? There is no great answer to this question. It really depends on the data and what it is you are trying to see. If you are trying to look at fine-grained information about the frequencies, then a higher number of bins would be appropriate. If you are attempting to see overall tendencies in the data, then fewer bins would make sense. If you reflect on the previous slide and this slide, you can see this happening. In the image on this slide, you can see that there is a strong central tendency in the data with the majority of the data sitting in the two center bins. This tendency is much more difficult to see in the more finely grained view that uses 10,000 bins. There are at least two clear spikes in the data just above 50 and just above 40, but otherwise the central overall tendency is invisible. 32",Book 2_2036060.pdf,33,"Here are the notes in advanced bullet-point markdown format:

**Choosing the Number of Bins in a Histogram**
==============================================

* There is no one-size-fits-all answer to the number of bins to use in a histogram; it depends on the data and the desired insights.
* **Fine-grained information**: Use a higher number of bins to see detailed frequency information.
* **Overall tendencies**: Use fewer bins to observe general trends in the data.

**Example: Central Tendency**
-----------------------------

* A histogram with **few bins** (e.g., 5 bins) reveals a strong central tendency in the data, with most data points clustering in the two center bins.
* A histogram with **many bins** (e.g., 10,000 bins) makes it harder to see the central tendency, but reveals **spikes** in the data (e.g., just above 50 and 40)."
"Let’s try to articulate these intuitions more formally. When we use a lower number of bins, we will naturally have correspondingly “wider” bins. These wider bins result in a much smoother histogram, with little or no “spiky” data. The effect of this is that we can no longer see details and outliers are digested into the wider bins. We can also say that histograms with smaller numbers of bins will be rendered more quickly. On the other hand, high numbers of bins translates to very narrow bins. These narrow bins will reveal all of the fine detail, producing a histogram that looks much rougher. While we lose the view of how the data behaves overall , outliers become very obvious. Finally, larger numbers of bins translates to longer, sometimes much longer, rendering times. 33",Book 2_2036060.pdf,34,"Here are the notes on the topic of Histograms and Bin Size in advanced markdown format:

**Histograms and Bin Size**
==========================

### Effect of Bin Size on Histograms
#### **Fewer Bins**
* Wider bins resulting in a smoother histogram
* Less detailed, with outliers digested into wider bins
* Faster rendering times

#### **More Bins**
* Narrower bins revealing fine details
* Rougher-looking histogram
* Outliers become very obvious
* Longer rendering times, possibly much longer"
"Let’s compare three histograms that analyze the same data. The data represents 10,000 random values. These values have a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10. When we graph these values with 64 bins, we have a pretty smooth histogram. We can also see that there appears to be, perhaps, a slight tendency for values below 50 to dominate the data; it almost looks like there is a very slight lean to the left. The center diagram examines this data using 729 bins. We can still see this overall tendency toward the left and can also see that there are some values that are generating both positive and negative spikes; some of the data is clearly higher than its neighbors and other bins are clearly lower than their neighbors. Looking at the final histogram with 4,096 bins, we find something that neither of the other his- tograms reveals. Both of the previous seem to show a left-leaning tendency. The final histogram shows that there is actually a significant spike at around 60, and that this value is at least 30% higher than the next most frequent value! We can also see that there are some completely empty bins below around 12, and between 12 and 20 and then 20 and 28 or so. 34",Book 2_2036060.pdf,35,"Here are the notes in advanced markdown format:

**Histogram Comparison**
============================

### Histogram 1: 64 Bins
* **Mean**: 50
* **Standard Deviation**: 10
* Observations:
	+ Slight tendency for values below 50 to dominate the data
	+ Histogram appears to lean slightly to the left

### Histogram 2: 729 Bins
* Observations:
	+ Still shows overall tendency toward the left
	+ Some values generate positive and negative spikes
	+ Some bins are higher or lower than their neighbors

### Histogram 3: 4,096 Bins
* Observations:
	+ **Significant spike** at around 60 (at least 30% higher than next most frequent value)
	+ Some **empty bins** below 12, between 12 and 20, and between 20 and 28

Note: The higher number of bins in Histogram 3 reveals more detailed information about the data, including the significant spike at 60 and empty bins in certain ranges."
"Mode There is another descriptive measure of our data that can prove useful in some situations: the mode . The mode of our data is the value that appears most frequently in the entire dataset. If you recall the histograms on the previous slide, that value around 60 that is very clearly more frequent than anything else would almost certainly be the mode of that data. Notice that the mode need not be anywhere near the mean or the median. We make use of the mode most often when we are working with categorical or discrete data. For example, if we are talking about the weather, we might define a number of categories. Perhaps we define categories such as rainy, snowy, sunny, cloudy, hot, and cold. Perhaps we collect data about these categories over time in Las Vegas. We find the following: Weather Frequency in Days Rainy 3.1 Snowy 0.15 Sunny 294 Cloudy 2.2 Hot 185 Cold 87 The average weather doesn’t really make much sense in this case. The mode, however, does. The mode of this data that best defines what the weather is like in Las Vegas is “Sunny.” 35",Book 2_2036060.pdf,36,"**Mode**
================

### Definition
* The mode is the value that appears most frequently in the entire dataset.

### Characteristics
* The mode need not be near the mean or median.
* Most useful when working with categorical or discrete data.

* Collecting data on weather in Las Vegas: rainy, snowy, sunny, cloudy, hot, and cold.
* Frequency of weather:

	+ Cloudy: 2.2 days
	+ Hot: 185 days
	+ Cold: 87 days
* The mode of this data is **Sunny**, which best describes the weather in Las Vegas.

**Key Concepts**

* **Mode**: the value that appears most frequently in the dataset
* **Categorical data**: data that can be grouped into categories (e.g., rainy, snowy, sunny, etc.)
* **Discrete data**: data that can only take on specific, distinct values (e.g., 0, 1, 2, etc.)"
"At this point, we have a number of different statistical tools that we can use to examine our data. How do we use them? Recall that in data science we said that the first two phases are to acquire data and to then explore the data. It is important that we embrace the idea of exploring data. Depending on our mathematics background, our experience might be limited to sets of rules and theorems that we can use to solve problems that are presented to us. These are often presented as though they are obvious universal truths that have always existed. This belies the truth of mathe- matics research. Take something simple that we accept as a fact. You were likely taught and had to memorize that the length of the hypotenuse of a triangle is equal to the square root of the sum of the squares of its sides. In other words, 𝑐 =√ 𝑎2+𝑏2wherea,b, andcare the lengths of the sides of a right triangle.cis the hypotenuse and aandbare the other two sides. Where does this formula come from? Why is this true? The answer is that thousands of years ago, mathematicians in ancient Greece and India (and likely other regions) spent time thinking about how a right triangle could be defined. After looking at and measuring triangles over and over, someone had the idea to see if there was some relationship between the lengths of the base, the height, and the hypotenuse. If you are good at visualizing geometric shapes mentally, then you can likely see intuitively that there must be a relationship. Based on this intuition and experimentation, people realized the relationship that we now teach is a basic truth, rule, or theorem of geometry. What’s the point of this story? When we are taught mathematics, we are taught things from the point of view of established facts. We are presented with problems and told which mathematics tools should be applied to them to arrive at an answer. In other words, we are taught that when we are presented with a problem that seeks answer X, we should apply technique Yto get there. What do we do when technique Ydoesn’t work? What do we do if no one has thought of the question 36",Book 2_2036060.pdf,37,"Here are the notes on the provided passage in advanced bullet-point markdown format:

"that we are seeking to answer, or if we aren’t even sure exactly what our question is (which makes selecting the “correct” technique or formula very difficult to identify)? The answer is that we need to experiment! This is where data exploration lives. Take the data you have and try applying the different tools that you have to see whether any interesting results arise. Unless someone has done the analysis previously and provided it as a technique or rule to you, there is no way to just know that any particular result will be interesting. This is where domain expertise comes in. If we handed a data scientist or statistician vast amounts of cybersecurity data, they could create all kinds of charts and graphs. However, it would be pretty difficult for them to know if any of the techniques that they are applying are revealing things that areinteresting . 37",Book 2_2036060.pdf,38,"Here are the notes on the provided passage in advanced bullet-point markdown format:

"Correlations One thing that we are almost always looking to do is to identify correlations . A correlation is some kind of relationship between one or more values. For example, college recruiters would have you believe that there is a direct correlation between the number of years of education that you have and the salary that you will earn. Is this true? If it is true, there should be a positivecorrelation when we take a sampling of both college graduates with their salaries and non-college-educated people with the same job roles. A positive correlation means that as the number of years of education increases, so does the income. This could be a linearcorrelation , which implies that the change is of the same relative magnitude. For example, someone with 1 year of education earns $10,000 more. Someone with 2 years of education earns $20,000 more. Someone with 3 years of education earns $30,000 more. This would be a linear correlation. Notice that the amounts do not have to increase by the same amount for the correlation to be linear. Instead, we see in this case that an increase of one in one value results in an increase of 10,000 in the other. The relative amount that they change does not vary appreciably. Anegative correlation means that the values vary inversely. As one value increases, the other decreases. Correlation Matrix Correlations definitely sound as though they would be useful to look at. How can we do this eas- ily? A common tool for doing so is a correlationmatrix . A correlation matrix applies some basic statistical analysis to determine how values vary relative to one another.

NetFlow records record things such as which hosts spoke to which hosts, when the flows occurred, how many packets were passed, the port numbers involved, the protocols used, the num- ber of bytes, etc. In our code example, we are executing this command over SSH and capturing the results, feeding them into a Pandas dataframe.

"For us, as budding data scientists, the numbers work just fine. We understand what the numbers mean. Even so, with a large correlation matrix, we would have to look closely at all of the cells to find strong correlations. For this reason, and to make our correlation matrices more accessible to others, we frequently present them as a heatmap . A heatmap typically is used to generate a colored diagram that illus- trates values that happen more frequently in one color and less frequently in another, with a wide range of color values between them. In our case, we are applying this technique to show how strong correlations are. We have used the default colors in our slide, where yellow is a correlation of 1.0. You can see the top-right corner and lower-left corner are very close colors. Correspondingly, the numeric values are also quite close. As you consider the other boxes, you can likely see the problem with the default color scheme. The center top box is a very dark color, which seems to mean that they are not closely correlated… but the actual value is 0.994! In the lab, we will look at how we can adjust the color map. You might wonder what this colormap is, though. The default colormap used by Matplotlib is Viridis. This colormap is ideal for people who suffer from achromatopsia1. We have chosen to use this colormap in many of the slides in the class to make viewing a black and white print version easier and also to make viewing the slides in class easier for those who have this visual impairment. 1Color blindness 41",Book 2_2036060.pdf,42,"Here are the notes on the topic of heatmap visualization of correlation matrices:

"Ultimately, this provides us with a visual tool that we can use to compare things to one another. Since we are approaching the data with some measure of domain expertise, we will often have intuitive knowledge about how the values are related. We can use a heatmap or correlation matrix to confirm our suspicions. There is another way that heatmaps can help us, though. Since we have a measure of domain knowl- edge, we may have a bias when it comes to correlations! In other words, based on our experience and knowledge, we may believe that we alreadyknow how variables are related and, therefore, we might not check. This represents a significant analysisbias and can lead to us missing important relations that we are totally unaware of. Getting into the habit of producing heatmaps or correlation matrices when exploring data can help us to identify correlations that we were previously unaware of. It may also help us to identify false correlations. What does this mean? Could it be that the data sample that we have collected has some skewed data in it? We might not just “know” this. Generating the heatmap might reveal a suspicious correlation that we weren’t aware of. More than this, we might absolutelyknow that there should be no correlation between the particular values in question. This can serve as a warning to us that our data is skewed, or that we might need to drop that particular piece of data from our analysis since it will skew the overall result. 42",Book 2_2036060.pdf,43,"Here are the notes in advanced bullet-point markdown format:

"Probability and Inference In this section, we are going to take a close look at probability and some important theorem. At first, this might feel like a huge shift in topic, but in fact probability and statistics really do go hand-in-hand. As with our other introductory topics covered, our goal is not to cover every aspect of probability theory but instead to familiarize you with some important fundamentals and one very important theorem. These will all contribute to the overall goals, of course.

"All of the topics that we have covered so far in the book look at descriptivestatistics . In other words, they describe the data in some way. While this is useful, this does not directly allow us to make inferences orpredictions about other data or perhaps future events. The ability to make inferences is critical for us since we are seeking ways that information can assist us in making decisions. More specifically, we are interested in analyzing and presenting information in such a way that it can assist us in making security-related decisions. Probability theory is a field that lends itself to exactly this problem. It is primarily about making inferences and predictions. Consider the notion of whether something is “ham or spam”1. Or perhaps whether a particular message is a legitimate email or a phishing attempt. What we are really talking about is what the likelihood is that either of these is true. One way that we could approach this would be to consider the words that are present in an email. What is the probability that a specific set of words will appear together in a normal message? Can we make any comparison to how frequently those same words might appear in a spam message or a phishing email? Might it be possible two work out some probabilities relative to these possibilities and use this to make a determination as to whether a specific message should be blocked? What we are describing is an approach toward a spam filter in where we are inferring or predicting whether a specific message is spam or phishing by generalizing based on a statistical analysis of known examples of normal versus abnormal and probabilities. 1Ham or spam is a common way of referring to whether a message is normal, valid email or unsolicited commercial email. 45",Book 2_2036060.pdf,46,"Here are the notes in advanced bullet-point markdown format:

**Descriptive Statistics vs. Inference**
=================================================

* Descriptive statistics describe data, but do not allow for making inferences or predictions about other data or future events.
* Inference is critical for decision-making, especially in security-related fields.

**Probability Theory**
=====================

* Probability theory is concerned with making inferences and predictions.
* It involves calculating the likelihood of an event occurring.

**Example: Spam Filter**
------------------------

* **Ham or spam** refers to determining whether an email is normal or unsolicited commercial email.
* To build a spam filter, we can:
	+ Analyze the words present in emails.
	+ Calculate the probability of specific word combinations in normal and spam messages.
	+ Compare the probabilities to determine the likelihood of a message being spam or phishing.
	+ Use this information to block suspicious messages.

**Key Concepts**
===============

* **Inference**: making conjectures or educated guesses based on data analysis.
* **Probability theory**: a field that deals with calculating the likelihood of events occurring."
"To begin building some important intuitions about probability, it is worthwhile to consider familiar scenarios where probability comes into play. As with most courses covering probability, we will examine probabilities involved in some forms of gaming1. Let’s consider roulette first. In case you are unfamiliar, in the game of roulette a croupier , or “Dealer”, begins a numbered wheel spinning. While the numbered wheel spins, the croupier releases a ball that is traveling in the opposite direction from the wheel. The numbers along the edge of the wheel are both even and odd between 0 and 36. The numbers also alternate color, with half black and half red. In American roulette, which is what we will consider here for the purposes of probabilities, there are actually two eros: A single ero (0) and double ero (00). The eros do not count as even or odd, nor do they count as low or high, or as black or red. Imagine that you have just walked up to a roulette table. You are tempted to place a bet. You can choose to bet on a specific number, whether the result will be low or high, even or odd, or many other combinations. Look at the display board that is pictured on the slide. This board shows you the last sixteen results from this roulette wheel. Based on what you see and know, what do you think the probability is that the next spin will result in an even number? 1Gaming is the polite term that is used in the place of gambling in places such as Las Vegas. 46",Book 2_2036060.pdf,47,"Here are the notes in advanced bullet-point format:

**Roulette and Probability**
===========================

* **Roulette Game**:
	+ Played with a spinning numbered wheel and a ball
	+ Numbers on the wheel: 0, 00, and 1-36 (even and odd)
	+ Numbers alternate between black and red
	+ **Eros (0 and 00)**: do not count as even/odd, low/high, or black/red
* **Betting Options**:
	+ Bet on a specific number
	+ Bet on low/high, even/odd, or other combinations
* **Understanding Probability**:
	+ Consider the last 16 results on the display board
	+ Estimate the probability of the next spin resulting in an even number

Note: The term ""gaming"" is used in the context of probability, a polite term used in places like Las Vegas instead of ""gambling""."
"Our natural intuition would be to count how many of the previous spins were odd numbers and how many even numbers have. If we do this, we find that there have been eight even numbers and seven odd numbers. This would intuitively tell us that an odd number is “due.” We might come to the same conclusion if we were to trying to decide if we wanted to select black or red. There have been seven red numbers and eight black. This seems to imply that a red number is slightly more likely. What about low or high? In this case, it appears that the answer is even clearer. There have been only four low numbers out of the last 16 and 11 high! Surely we should place a huge wager on a low number coming up next. The trouble with this reasoning is that our intuition is absolutely wrong. If the current spin results in an even number, this result has absolutely no influence on what the next spin will be. To determine the probability, we need to work out what the likelihood is that an even or odd, a red or black, or a high or low value will come up. In all three of these cases, there are 18 different ways that you can win. Unfortunately, there are 20 ways that you can lose. Why 20? The numbers do run from 1 through 36, which makes us feel that it is 50/50, but don’t forget the eros! These two additional values mean that the probability of winning is: 𝑃(𝑙𝑜𝑤) = 18/38 = 0.47×100 = 47% If the probability of winning is 47%, then the probability of losing is 53%. It turns out that these are really good odds. The “house” has one of its smallest advantages in this particular game when making one of these three bets. 47",Book 2_2036060.pdf,48,"Here are the summary notes in advanced markdown format:
### Roulette Intuition vs. Probability
#### Mistaken Intuition
* Our natural intuition may lead us to believe that:
	+ An odd number is ""due"" after 8 even numbers and 7 odd numbers.
	+ A red number is more likely after 7 red numbers and 8 black numbers.
	+ A low number is more likely after 4 low numbers and 11 high numbers.

#### The Problem with Intuition
* This thinking is **flawed**, as each spin is an **independent event**.
* The previous spins have **no influence** on the next spin.

#### Probability of Winning
* There are **18 ways to win** and **20 ways to lose** (1-36, plus 0 and 00).
* The **probability of winning** is: 
	+ 𝑃(𝑙𝑜𝑤) = 18/38 = **47%**
	+ The **probability of losing** is: **53%**

#### Conclusion
* The house has a relatively small advantage in this game, making these bets attractive."
"Let’s build an experiment so that we can evaluate this empirically. In the slide, we have some Python code that builds a virtual roulette wheel. Our virtual wheel includes 0, 00, and the digits from 1 to 38. Once we have built our wheel, let’s give it 10,000 spins. With the 10,000 spins completed, we then process a list comprehension to extract results. The main logic in the list comprehension is checking whether the result is even or odd. Notice that we have an additional condition present that is checking to see if the resulting spin is greater than ero. If the spin was a ero, we ignore that result, not counting it as even. We then ask to have this data potted. While our code is attempting to measure how frequently even or odd come up, we are sure that you can see that tweaking the code to evaluate red or black or high or low would result in the identical graph. If you are not convinced of this, please feel free to use this starter code to prove that to yourself. In the end, we can see that in 10,000 spins, the accuracy of the ratio that we evaluated on the last slide is proven true. While this pattern might not be immediately apparent when looking at five or six examples, when taken in large numbers, the truth of the probability theories becomes obvious. 48",Book 2_2036060.pdf,49,"Here are the notes in advanced bullet-point markdown format:

### Running the Simulation
* 10,000 spins are performed
* List comprehension extracts results, checking:

### Observations and Conclusion
* After 10,000 spins, the ratio of even to odd results approaches the true probability
* This pattern may not be apparent with small sample sizes (e.g., 5-6 examples), but becomes clear with large numbers."
"Joint vs. Conditional Let’s change games and both expand and refine our understanding of probabilities. We have just worked out that the probability of getting an even or odd result is just 47%. But what is the proba- bility that two spins in a row will be even? Or the three spins in a row? This is another area where our intuitions can lead us astray. There are two types of probability that could be applied to this problem one of these is a joint probability. A joint probability attempts to predict the likelihood that two independent1events occur simultaneously or jointly . Let’s illustrate this with a deck of cards. What is the probability that, if you were to make a free choice of a card without looking, you would draw a card that is both black and a queen? This isn’t hard to work out. 𝑃(𝑞𝑢𝑒𝑒𝑛) =4 52=1 13,𝑃(𝑏𝑙𝑎𝑐𝑘) =26 52=1 2 The joint probability would be the product of these two cases: 𝑃(𝑞𝑢𝑒𝑒𝑛∩𝑏𝑙𝑎𝑐𝑘) = 𝑃(𝑞𝑢𝑒𝑒𝑛)×𝑃(𝑏𝑙𝑎𝑐𝑘) =1 13×1 2=1 26 Let’s think this through logically and see if it works out. The chance that the card we have drawn is a queen would be 4 cards out of 52. Reducing this fraction, we obtain a result of 1 out of 13. This 1Independent events are events where the outcome of one does not depend on the outcome of the other. Deceptively, it intuitively feels as though this is the way to answer our roulette question, but it isn’t. 49",Book 2_2036060.pdf,50,"Here are the notes on Joint vs. Conditional Probability in advanced markdown format:

**Joint Probability**
=====================

* **Definition**: The probability that two **independent** events occur simultaneously or jointly.
* **Formula**: 𝑃(A ∩ B) = 𝑃(A) × 𝑃(B)

**Example: Drawing a Queen of Spades from a Deck**
-------------------------------------------------

* 𝑃(queen) = 4/52 = 1/13
* 𝑃(black) = 26/52 = 1/2
* 𝑃(queen ∩ black) = 𝑃(queen) × 𝑃(black) = 1/13 × 1/2 = 1/26

* **Independent events**: Events where the outcome of one does not depend on the outcome of the other.
* **Joint probability**: The probability of two or more independent events occurring together.

* Intuition can lead us astray when dealing with joint probabilities, and a logical approach is necessary to arrive at the correct answer."
"makes perfect sense so far since the queen is one out of thirteen possible cards in any given suit. Next, we have the question of whether the card is red or black. Since we know that half of the cards are red and half are black, or alternatively that two of the suits are black and two are red, if we are holding a queen it is a 50-50 chance that it is a black queen.1 2of1 13is1 26.

* Since there are **2** red suits and **2** black suits, the probability of a Queen being black is **50-50** or **50%**.

**Mathematical Representation**
-----------------------------

"While joint probability makes sense and is appropriate to use for our card problem, it is the wrong approach to solving our roulette question. Instead, we are really asking a conditionalprobability question. A useful way for you to think about conditional probability is to think of saying, “given that𝑌has already occurred, what is the probability that 𝑋will occur?”” If you think about our roulette problem, that is exactly what we’re asking. Given that we have spun and an even number has come up, for instance, what is the probability that the next spin is also even? Let’s think about this using playing cards again and come up with a completely non-intuitive con- clusion. Rather than viewing the card problem as a simultaneous or joint probability, let’s think about it as a conditional probability. That means that we are asking, “given that you have drawn a black card, what is the probability that when you look at it, it is a queen?” This might feel the same, but it is subtly different. Our original question was, “if you draw a card what is the probability that it is simultaneously both black and a queen?” We are now describing a slightly different situation. A card is drawn. What is the probability that someone looks at it and tells you that that card is black, and then the card is revealed to be a queen? This can lead us to the following conclusion: 𝑃(𝑞𝑢𝑒𝑒𝑛|𝑏𝑙𝑎𝑐𝑘) =2 26=1 13∵2 of the 26 black cards are queens It should strike you that something is wrong here. How can this work out to be more likely than the keys from the last slide? Let’s see if we can resolve this and solve our roulette problem. 51",Book 2_2036060.pdf,52,"Here are the notes in advanced bullet-point markdown format:

**Conditional Probability vs. Joint Probability**
------------------------------------------------

* **Joint Probability**: Asking about the probability of two events occurring simultaneously (e.g., drawing a card that is both black and a queen)
* **Conditional Probability**: Asking about the probability of one event occurring given that another event has already occurred (e.g., drawing a black card and then finding out it's a queen)

**Example with Playing Cards**
-----------------------------

* **Original Question**: If you draw a card, what is the probability that it is simultaneously both black and a queen?

"We know that we have a 47% chance of an even number every time the roulette wheel is spun. Since we are trying to determine a likelihood of 10 events happening in a row, this is a conditional probability problem. Solving these problems means that we should be multiplying the probability of one thing occurring times the probability of the other.

This seems fine, but here comes something really counterintuitive. Let’s work out a slightly different probability: 𝑃(𝑒𝑣𝑒𝑛) =18 38=9 19,𝑃(𝑜𝑑𝑑) =18 38=9 19∴𝑝(𝑒𝑣𝑒𝑛|𝑜𝑑𝑑) = (9 19)2=81 361= 22% Wait, what? How can this be?

"Equating Joint and Conditional Probabilities We are very close to being able to make some practical applications of this to our information security problems. You should sense from what has been covered so far that we must carefully select how we approach probability problems. It is very easy to apply the wrong formula Best simply on how we conceptualize the problem. Just because the numbers can fit into a formula, does not mean that that formula is giving us a result that is relevant for our problem. If we apply these formulas in the wrong way, we can end up with unexpected results or make poorly informed decisions. It turns out, though, that there is a very strong relationship between joint and conditional probability. In fact, we can define each of these in terms of the other. This turns out to be extremely important and very useful. Here is the algebraic relationship: 𝑃(𝑋 ∩𝑌) = 𝑃(𝑋|𝑌)×𝑃(𝑌) This might not seem like much, but we will manipulate this shortly and turn it into something very powerful. Before we do, let’s apply this problem to our current question. Remember that we got strange results when we asked what’s the probability that a card is a queen given that the card is black. The formula for a joint probability is the conditional probability multiplied by the probability of the antecedent. In this case, our antecedent would be that the card selected is black. In other words, when we multiply the conditional probability by the probability of the antecedent occurring, we arrive at the joint probability.

"It’s time for some algebraic manipulation. It turns out that there are some very interesting things that we can derive by applying some basic algebraic rules. For example, we know that multiplication iscommutative . This means that the order in which terms are multiplied does not matter. Written mathematically, we can rewrite some of our probability equations as follows: 𝑃(𝑋)×𝑃(𝑌) = 𝑃(𝑌)×𝑃(𝑋) ∴ 𝑃(𝑋 ∩𝑌) = 𝑃(𝑌 ∩𝑋) Do not dismiss this as being trivial just yet. There are some other manipulations that produce some interesting ways to view probabilities: 𝑃(𝑋 ∩𝑌) = 𝑃(𝑋|𝑌)×𝑃(𝑌) 𝑃(𝑋|𝑌) =𝑃(𝑋 ∩𝑌) 𝑃(𝑌)and𝑃(𝑌) =𝑃(𝑋 ∩𝑌) 𝑃(𝑋|𝑌) In this case, we begin with the joint probability of XandYbeing equivalent to the conditional probability of XgivenYmultiplied by the probability of Y. We can move the probability of Yto the left-hand side of this equation using algebraic rules. This yields the probability of XgivenYbeing equal to the joint probability of XandYdivided by the probability of Y. If we instead divide by the conditional probability of XgivenY, we can define the probability of Yas a ratio between the joint and conditional probabilities. 55",Book 2_2036060.pdf,56,"Here are the notes on algebraic manipulation of probability equations in advanced markdown format:

=====================

### Introduction

* Bayes' Theorem is a mathematical formula that helps in updating the probability of an event based on new information.
* It is used to find the conditional probability of an event `𝑌` given `𝑋`, denoted as `𝑃(𝑌|𝑋)`, when the probability of `𝑋` given `𝑌`, denoted as `𝑃(𝑋|𝑌)`, is known.

### Formula

* `𝑃(𝑌|𝑋) = 𝑃(𝑋|𝑌) × 𝑃(𝑌) / 𝑃(𝑋)`

### Derivation

* Start with the formula: `𝑃(𝑋|𝑌) = 𝑃(𝑋 ∩ 𝑌) / 𝑃(𝑌)`
* Rearrange to get: `𝑃(𝑋 ∩ 𝑌) = 𝑃(𝑋|𝑌) × 𝑃(𝑌)`
* Since `𝑃(𝑋 ∩ 𝑌) = 𝑃(𝑌 ∩ 𝑋)`, substitute this into the equation.
* Rearrange again to get the desired formula: `𝑃(𝑌|𝑋) = 𝑃(𝑋|𝑌) × 𝑃(𝑌) / 𝑃(𝑋)`

* **Conditional Probability**: the probability of an event occurring given that another event has occurred.
* **Joint Probability**: the probability of two events occurring together.

"That name might not mean much to you at first, but almost all spam filtering tools that you find in email clients and mail servers are Bayesian filters.

What Bayes Theorem allows us to do is to consider an unknown message and work out the prob- ability that a particular message is spam given the presence of a specific word. It allows us to do this by using known information from past data. This means that we are able to infer or to predict something that is unknown based on easily known facts. 𝑛 ∑ 𝑖=0𝑃(𝑠𝑝𝑎𝑚|𝑤𝑜𝑟𝑑𝑖) which is computed using 𝑃(𝑤𝑜𝑟𝑑𝑖|𝑠𝑝𝑎𝑚)×𝑃(𝑤𝑜𝑟𝑑𝑖) 𝑃(𝑤𝑜𝑟𝑑𝑖) 58,Book 2_2036060.pdf,59,"**Bayes Theorem Notes**

"Lab 4: Probability, Bayes, and Spam/Phish Let’s try this out in a lab. In this lab, we are going to make use of some of the web scraping that we worked on in Day 1. You will recall that we built a Mongo database containing phishing email messages. Is it possible to use this data to produce a likelihood that an unknown message is spam? Just in case that doesn’t work out, we also have a large repository of email from the Enron scandal. This email data was made public following the collapse and subsequent legal proceedings involving Enron. The data has been conveniently broken into ham and spam categories. If needed, we can also use this to build a model and then evaluate known ham and spam to see how well our filter works. 59",Book 2_2036060.pdf,60,"Here are the notes on Lab 4: Probability, Bayes, and Spam/Phish:

"The data that we have available on our networks and systems is frequently collected over time. We could say that it is sequential data that is represented in the time domain. Ahappens, then B happens, then Chappens, then Ahappens again, and so on. We have seen statistical tools that allow us to describe the data in various ways. One of the ways that we can describe it is to examine how frequently certain things happen. But could there be another way to look at frequency? For instance, if you think about what we have done with histograms, which are frequency plots, and then think about an FM radio or Wi-Fi signals, how could you represent a radio signal on a histogram? Could you easily identify the frequency at which the Wi-Fi is operating, finding that coherent signal in all of the noise that is occurring within the overall band? It seems as though this should be possible, but how can we do it? If that problem sounds interesting, but you cannot think of how you could do this with a histogram, don’t worry. This is not a trivial problem. However, it could be very interesting to convert from the time domain, which is how our logs are typically recorded, to the frequency domain to identify the spectraldensity1of signals. 1The spectral density is a way of analyzing our signals to determine at which frequency coherent signals are present. 61",Book 2_2036060.pdf,62,"Here are the notes on the topic of sequential data analysis in advanced markdown format:

"Let’s explore this problem a little bit more before coming up with a solution. Let’s imagine that we have a NetFlow collector running on our network. This NetFlow sensor will collect metadata describing all of the flows that occur. The data within the NetFlow repository is all recorded as unidirectional flows. This means that if we were looking at a TCP connection, for example, there would be two flows recorded. One flow would go from the originator, or client, to the responding host, or server. The second flow would go from the server back to the client. Each of the flows will record the IP addresses, the port numbers, the number of packets, the number of bytes, and other metadata related to the flow. Imagine we have this data for every connection that has occurred in our network over the last six months. It seems likely that there must be some way that we could use the data to identify whether or not there are any beacons . In this case, we are using the idea of beacon as it is used with malware. Imagine some new piece of malware infecting an endpoint. This malware could provide remote control of the host, it could steal data, or do any number of other things. However, as soon as the system is infected, it needs to “phone home”. Especially because our firewalls will typically limit what kind of inbound connections are possible, it is necessary for malware to establish outgoing connections to obtain instructions for what to do next. Many pieces of malware, and many botnet-infected hosts, will periodically connect back to a command and control server (C2 server). These periodic connections are checking to see if there are any instructions that should be executed by the malware. How often does it occur? It could be at any interval. Some of these are very aggressive, sending queries out every few seconds. Some attempt to fly under the radar, sending out a probe only once every several minutes or perhaps even less frequently. Regardless of frequency, a key point is that these connections will be periodic . This means that they occur at regular intervals. 62",Book 2_2036060.pdf,63,"Here are the notes in advanced bullet-point markdown format:

"Periodicity Let’s explore this idea of a periodic signal by looking at a math function that is periodic. In the slide, we have a graph of a sine wave. The sine function is periodic. This means that the values oscillate between two values, in this case, positive one and negative one, at regular intervals (or periods). This also proves to be a continuous function1. We can intuit that sine must be a periodic function when we think about what the sine function represents. We know that sine is the ratio of the height of a right triangle divided by its base. In fact, if we were to set the length of the hypotenuse to be a static value and then sweep through all possible values for the base and height, the result would trace out a circle. Circular paths are, by nature, periodic. Looking at the example in the slide, what is the frequency of this sine wave? When we are working with signals in the field of physics, we usually use hertz as the unit of measurement. This is a measure of the number of cycles, or periods, per second. If the x-axis in the graph represents seconds, then this graph shows 10 cycles in 1 second. Therefore, the frequency of this sine wave is 10 Hz. 1Recall that we previously defined a continuous function as any function that has a corresponding value in the codomain for every possible value in the domain and that the changes in the domain do not result in abrupt changes in the codomain 63",Book 2_2036060.pdf,64,"Here are the notes on Periodicity in advanced markdown format:

**Periodicity**
===============

### Definition of Periodicity
* A function is **periodic** if its values oscillate between two values at regular intervals (or periods).

### Example: Sine Function
* The **sine function** is periodic.
* The values of the sine function oscillate between **+1 and -1**.
* The sine function is also a **continuous function**.

### Why is Sine a Periodic Function?
* Sine represents the ratio of the height of a right triangle to its base.
* If we sweep through all possible values for the base and height while keeping the hypotenuse length static, we trace out a **circle**.
* Circular paths are inherently **periodic**.

### Frequency of a Sine Wave
* **Frequency** is measured in **hertz (Hz)**, which represents the number of cycles (or periods) per second.
* In the example graph, there are **10 cycles in 1 second**, so the frequency of the sine wave is **10 Hz**.

**Vocabulary Terms**

* **Periodicity**: the quality of a function that oscillates between two values at regular intervals.
* **Continuous function**: a function that has a corresponding value in the codomain for every possible value in the domain, with no abrupt changes.
* **Hertz (Hz)**: a unit of measurement for frequency, representing the number of cycles (or periods) per second."
"Since we currently have the signal in the time domain and we would like to see it represented in the frequency domain, our first attempt at solving this problem might be to use a frequency-related tool like the histogram. However, the histogram proves inadequate. Notice the output of the histogram when we graph all of the values of this 10 Hz sine wave. We can see that the bins containing -1.0 and 1.0 occur most frequently, while the values around 0.0 occur the least frequently. This should give us an inkling that the kind of frequency we are measuring here is somehow different. The key to this problem revolves around us defining frequency in terms of a period rather than how many times something happens. These turn out to be quite different. 64",Book 2_2036060.pdf,65,"Here are the notes in advanced bullet-point format:

**Frequency Domain**
=====================

* Need to represent signal in **frequency domain** from **time domain**

**Histogram Limitations**
---------------------

* Output of histogram for 10 Hz sine wave:
	+ Bins containing **-1.0 and 1.0** occur most frequently
	+ Values around **0.0** occur least frequently
* Indicates that frequency measured is different from expected

**Defining Frequency**
-------------------

* Key to problem: defining frequency in terms of **period** rather than **how many times something happens**
* Period and frequency are **distinct concepts**"
"Before we move on from this, let’s just make sure we understand why this graph makes sense, and why it’s not what we need. A histogram counts how frequently specific values occur. If you think of the graph of a sine curve, you could think of starting at the top of the curve and then shooting down like a roller coaster all the way to -1. Once we reach this value, we turn and begin our trek back up until we meet the next peak at 1.0. Consider what’s happening with the slope. As we reach the value of 1 or -1, the slope flattens out to 0. However, the slope through 0 is always 1, or -1. In other words, the sine curve moves through values surrounding 0 far more quickly than it moves through the values at either the top or bottom of the curve. We can make changes to the curve to speed it up or to slow it down, but this will make no change in the histogram that we see. Certainly, there will either be more or fewer values overall in the same time window, but the relationship between the frequency with which each value appears will not change. We can also change the amplitude, or the power, in the same way. This will change our histogram since the top and bottom of the curve will change, either going up or down depending on if we are making a larger amplitude or smaller amplitude. No matter what change we make, the sine wave is still cycling periodically. It is the frequencywith whichthecyclesoccur that we are really seeking to measure. This is why the histogram is the wrong tool. 65",Book 2_2036060.pdf,66,"Here are the notes on the topic in advanced bullet-point format:

**Understanding the Sine Curve and Histogram**
=====================================================

### Key Concepts
* **Histogram**: counts the frequency of specific values
* **Sine Curve**: a periodic curve that oscillates between -1 and 1

### Characteristics of the Sine Curve
* The slope of the sine curve:
	+ flattens out to 0 at values of 1 or -1
	+ is always 1 or -1 at values surrounding 0
* The sine curve moves quickly through values surrounding 0 and slowly through values at the top or bottom of the curve

### Effects of Changes to the Sine Curve
* Changing the **amplitude** (power) of the sine curve:
	+ affects the histogram by changing the top and bottom of the curve
	+ increases or decreases the frequency of values
* Changing the **frequency** of the sine curve:
	+ does not affect the histogram
	+ changes the rate at which the curve cycles periodically

### Limitations of the Histogram
* The histogram is not suitable for measuring the frequency of cycles in the sine curve
* It is the **frequency of cycles** that we are trying to measure, not the frequency of specific values"
"This means that we have identified the real heart of our problem. The thing that we are seeking to identify is periodic behavior. More than this, we are seeking to identify what the frequency of those periods are. If we think of this in terms of malware beacons, we are asking two questions: Are there beacons? If there are, how frequently are they connecting back for instructions? We are sure you can sense that this would be a very useful analysis to conduct.

"Let’s put this into pictures. Consider the activity in the slide above. Let us say that the data above represents packets per second over 1000 seconds. We are interested in identifying periodic activity. What if we could apply some kind of transformation that could turn the graph on the top into the graph on the bottom?

Notice in the bottom diagram how obvious it is that there is a clear and coherent signal occurring at a specific frequency.

"Let’s take a short digression into the topic of infinite series. An infinite series is a mathematical construct that can be used to represent irrational numbers, calculate approximations, and explore other interesting ideas. We’d like to take a few moments to explain how we can construct an infinite series that can be used to approximate the value of sine over a range of values. Why are we doing this? The biggest reason is that the signals analysis tools we will use at the end of this section are based on infinite series. Another reason is that sine is a periodic signal, so this is all directly related to where we are heading. As we have previously stated, we know that the sine of an angle is defined as the ratio of the side of a right triangle opposite that angle divided by the hypotenuse. We could also state this as the ratio of the height divided by the base. If we have an actual right triangle on hand and a very accurate ruler, we could calculate the value of any angle by measuring the sides and performing the division. What if we would like to work out the value of a specific angle and we don’t have a triangle that we can measure? What if we would like to create a table listing the values of sine, or a function that can give us an approximate for the values of sign? Is there some formula that we can derive, a general way of calculating the correct value of sine for any arbitrary angle? Your first instinct might be that there must be something we can do using algebra. Solving this prob- lem using only algebra, however, proves very elusive. In fact, most of us when learning trigonom- etry were forced to memorize specific values of sine, cosine, and tangent so that we could solve trigonometric problems. Rather than using mathematics tools that could approximate the answer, we would instead do a rough approximation based on the values that we had memorized. This isn’t an ideal solution. It certainly does not give us a mechanism for determining a highly accurate value for any arbitrary angle. 68",Book 2_2036060.pdf,69,"**Infinite Series and Approximating Sine**

### Introduction to Infinite Series
* **Infinite series**: a mathematical construct used to represent irrational numbers, calculate approximations, and explore other interesting ideas.

### Motivation for Approximating Sine
* **Reason 1**: signals analysis tools used later in the section are based on infinite series.
* **Reason 2**: sine is a periodic signal, and this is directly related to the topics that follow.

### Definition of Sine
* **Sine**: the ratio of the side of a right triangle opposite an angle to the hypotenuse (or the ratio of the height to the base).

### Problem: Calculating Sine without a Triangle
* **Challenge**: calculate the value of a specific angle without a physical triangle to measure.
* **Goal**: derive a formula or method to calculate the correct value of sine for any arbitrary angle.

### Limitations of Algebraic Methods
* **Difficulty**: using algebra alone to solve this problem is very elusive.
* **Traditional approach**: memorize specific values of sine, cosine, and tangent to solve trigonometric problems, which is not ideal for determining highly accurate values for any arbitrary angle."
"Infinite Series As promised, this class is not a rigorous class. This means that we are not going to provide proofs for anything, and we will ask you to simply believe that certain things are true. To solve the problem that we are considering for an approximation of sine, we are going to need to make use of some calculus tools. When you learn differential calculus, you learn a series of rules that can be used to determine the derivative of functions. In simple terms, the derivative of a function tells you what the slope of the function is. More generally, it is a way of expressing how the value of one term changes relative to another. One such rule is the PowerRule . When learning calculus, you normally struggle through several weeks of calculating derivatives manually. It can take pages of algebraic manipulations to come up with the solution to a single problem. After this grueling experience, the first tool for calculating derivatives to which you are introduced is this Power Rule. The simplicity of the Power Rule is that you use the exponents of theindependentvariable1and multiply them by the coefficients, subtracting one from the value of the exponent. For example: 𝑓(𝑥) = 2𝑥2+3 𝑓′(𝑥) = 2×2×𝑥+0×3 = 4𝑥+0 Why is 3 multiplied by 0? Because we could also write that equation as 𝑓(𝑥) = 2𝑥2+ 3𝑥0. Therefore, when we multiply 3 by the power to which 𝑥is raised, we arrive at the value of ero. 1Independent variables can be thought of as causes and dependent variables as effects . In the formula 𝑦 = 𝑚𝑥+𝑏 , 𝑥is independent and 𝑦is dependent. Specifically, 𝑦is dependent on 𝑥. 69",Book 2_2036060.pdf,70,"Here are the notes on Infinite Series and Calculus in advanced markdown format:

"We can also use the inverse of the paragraph to calculate the anti-derivative or integral. All this means is that we are starting with a function like 𝑓(𝑥) = 4𝑥 and attempting to determine what higher order function it is the derivative of. To do this, we just reverse the process: 𝑓′(𝑥) = 4𝑥 4𝑥2 2+𝑐 = 2𝑥2+𝑐 In this result, 𝑐represents some constant. What should the value of that constant be? We cannot tell. In effect, the process of differentiation eliminated all trace of that value from the resulting derivative. What we have calculated here is known as the indefiniteintegral . Why indefinite? Because we don’t know the value for 𝑐.𝑐could be ero, but it could also be any other value. It is in this sense that the integral is indefinite. 70",Book 2_2036060.pdf,71,"Here are the notes on the topic of calculating anti-derivative or integral in advanced markdown format:

**Key Concept:** Calculating the anti-derivative or integral of a function involves finding the higher order function of which the given function is the derivative.

**Given Function:** The given function is **f(x) = 4x**.

**Process:** To calculate the anti-derivative or integral, we reverse the process of differentiation.

**Calculation:** f'(x) = 4x → ∫f(x)dx = **x^2 + c**, where **c** represents some constant.

**Indefinite Integral:** The calculated result is known as the **indefinite integral** because we don't know the value of **c**. **c** could be 0, but it could also be any other value.

"What does this have to do with our approximation for sine? It turns out that we are going to be very interested in derivatives. Don’t worry, though, we won’t have to calculate any. We will give you all of the values for the derivatives that you will need. To begin, we know, perhaps from a chart of sine values, that the value of sine at ero is ero. That seems like a great place to start. In fact, we can very easily define a function that is perfectly accurate in approximating sine at ero: 𝑓(𝑥) = 0 It might seem at first glance that this isn’t exactly intuitive. In fact, it might seem at first that this is somewhat foolish. However, in all cases where sine of ero is calculated, the value will always be ero. Not only this, but since sine is a periodic function, this value must be correct at least twice in every period! This probably has you thinking about the joke about broken clocks being right at least twice each day. Don’t worry, this does get better. As wonderful as our approximation is when 𝑥 = 0 , as we proceed through a period, heading toward 𝜋 2radians or 90°, our approximation gets worse and worse. 71",Book 2_2036060.pdf,72,"Here are the notes on the topic in advanced bullet-point format:

* **Perfect Approximation at Zero**: A function can be defined to accurately approximate sine at 0: **`f(x) = 0`**.
* **Intuition and Accuracy**: At first, this approximation might seem unintuitive or foolish, but it's accurate for sine at 0, and since sine is periodic, this value is correct at least twice in every period.

"Let’s visualize how well our approximation is working so far. As expected, the graph shows that at the beginning of the period, the middle of the period, and the end of the period (which we could view as either a part of this period or the start of the next), our approximation is completely correct. However, for all other values, it is wrong. When we are1 4of the way through or3 4of the way through the period, we are at our worst approximation.

"Let’s think about where we can go from here. What we’d really like to know is what term we can add to our current function, 𝑓(𝑥) = 0 , that will nudge our result in the right direction. 𝑓(𝑥) = 0+? One way to think about this is to ask what the behavior of the sine function is around this point. What does it do immediately to the right? What does it do immediately to the left? Asking how a function changes is akin to asking what its slope is, or what the change in y is in relation to the change in x. Said mathematically, by definition, 𝑠𝑙𝑜𝑝𝑒 =𝑑𝑦 𝑑𝑥. What is the slope of the sine function is right around this point? It turns out that we have a way to calculate the slope of a function. The slope, or how this function changes, would be the derivative of the function. Since the sine function is a continuous and differentiable function1, we can determine the derivative for it! If we know what the derivative of it is, perhaps we could use the anti-derivative to determine what value to add to our approximation for the next term… 1Differentiable means that for all possible values of 𝑥, the derivative is defined. While not terribly important for us at this point in the class, just because a function isn’t differentiable at all points does not mean that its derivative is useless or that its slope cannot be calculated. Some of our machine learning activationfunctions , which we will define much later, make use of this property. 73",Book 2_2036060.pdf,74,"**Derivatives and Approximations**

* The second derivative of **sine** is **-sine**.
* The third derivative of **sine** is **-cosine**.
* The fourth derivative of **sine** is **sine**.
* The pattern of derivatives repeats every four iterations.

**Periodic Nature**
-----------------

* The derivative of a **periodic function** (such as sine) is also periodic.
* This means that we only need to calculate the derivative four times before the values start to repeat.
* This cyclic nature makes the derivatives of sine easy to remember.

Let me know if you need anything else!"
"So far, this turns out to be pretty convenient. In fact, while we could have used any infinite series to illustrate this, the sine and cosine functions are particularly useful because the values turn out to be so simple. Now that we know what the derivatives would be symbolically, we need to calculate what the derivatives are equal to at the value 𝑥 = 0 , which is where our approximation is centered. Evaluate at ero The Value 𝑐𝑜𝑠(𝑥) 0 −𝑠𝑖𝑛(𝑥) 1 −𝑐𝑜𝑠(𝑥) 0 𝑠𝑖𝑛(𝑥) -1 𝑐𝑜𝑠(𝑥) 0 −𝑠𝑖𝑛(𝑥) 1 −𝑐𝑜𝑠(𝑥) 0 Again, these values are cyclic or periodic, which is exactly what we would expect for a periodic function. In the case of sine and cosine, the values are conveniently simple. 75",Book 2_2036060.pdf,76,"Here are the notes on the topic of sine and cosine functions and their derivatives:

"Let’s talk about what to do with these values. Returning to what we know, the value of sine at ero is equal to ero( 𝑠𝑖𝑛(0) = 0 ). Our function already captures this. The first derivative of sine tells us that the slope of sine at ero is one ( 𝑠𝑖𝑛′(0) = 1 ). What value must appear in our function such that when the first derivative is taken, the result of that function when 𝑥 = 0 is one? 76",Book 2_2036060.pdf,77,"**Sine Function Properties**
===========================

* **First Derivative of Sine**: The slope of sine at 0 is 1 (𝑠𝑖𝑛′(0) = 1)
* **Function Requirement**: The function must be designed such that when the first derivative is taken, the result is 1 when 𝑥 = 0"
"Applying what we know about the anti-derivative, we are trying to determine what function, when the derivative is taken, produces a result of 1. This turns out to be much easier than you might expect. In fact, the answer is so easy, you might overlook it assuming that it can’t possibly be so simple. ∫1 =1𝑥1 1+𝑐 What do we do with this and our approximation? We can just add it on! 𝑓(𝑥) = 0+𝑥 As impossibly simple as that seems, look at our graph now. Adding this one additional value seems to create an incredibly accurate approximation of sine for values very close to ero. Of course, the further away from ero we move, the worse the approximation becomes. Still, the addition of just this one simple term has made a huge impact. Can we make this better? 77",Book 2_2036060.pdf,78,"Here are the notes in advanced bullet-point format:

**Finding the Anti-Derivative of 1**
* The goal is to find the function that, when differentiated, produces a result of 1
* The answer is surprisingly simple: **∫1 = x + C**

**Improving the Approximation of Sine**
* Adding the anti-derivative of 1 to our previous approximation: **f(x) = 0 + x**
* This simple addition creates an incredibly accurate approximation of sine for values close to 0
* The approximation becomes less accurate as we move further away from 0

* **Anti-derivative**: a function that, when differentiated, produces a given function
* **Integration**: the process of finding the anti-derivative of a function"
"The question we are really asking is how does the first derivative behave? Asked another way, how does it change? The mathematics tool for determining how something changes is the derivative. So what is the second derivative of sine? And what does it evaluate to at 0? We know from our chart that the second derivative of sine is −𝑠𝑖𝑛(𝑥) and that the value of this at 0 is 0. As a result, we know right away that we can add a term of ero, but that it has no real effect on the outcome. So, we need to look at the third derivative. The third derivative of the sine function is −𝑐𝑜𝑠(𝑥) which evaluates to −𝑐𝑜𝑠(0) = −1 . Can we add this into our existing approximation? Absolutely. We know that the term we are looking to add would be some coefficient along with 𝑥3. Since we are looking at the third derivative, we would effectively need to calculate the 3rd anti-derivative or triple integral. Think about how this would work. 𝑓(𝑥) = 𝑥3 𝑓′(𝑥) = 3𝑥2 𝑓″(𝑥) = 3×2𝑥1 𝑓‴(𝑥) = 3×2×1𝑥0 Weknowthat 𝑓‴(𝑠𝑖𝑛(𝑥)) = −1 ∴ ∫∫∫−1 = −1×𝑥3 3×2×1+𝑐 = −𝑥3 6+𝑐 78",Book 2_2036060.pdf,79,"Here are the notes on the topic of derivatives and their behavior:

**Derivatives and Their Behavior**
=====================================

### Question

* How does the first derivative behave?
* How does it change?

### Tools
-----------

* **Derivative**: a mathematics tool for determining how something changes

### Second Derivative of Sine
---------------------------

* **Second derivative of sine**: −𝑠𝑖𝑛(𝑥)
* Value at 0: 0
* Effect on outcome: negligible

### Third Derivative of Sine
---------------------------

* **Third derivative of sine**: −𝑐𝑜𝑠(𝑥)
* Value at 0: −1
* Can be added to existing approximation

### Calculating Coefficients
-------------------------

* **Triple integral**: calculating the 3rd anti-derivative
* Example:
	+ 𝑓(𝑥) = 𝑥³
	+ 𝑓′(𝑥) = 3𝑥²
	+ 𝑓″(𝑥) = 3×2𝑥¹
	+ 𝑓‴(𝑥) = 3×2×1𝑥⁰
* Value of 𝑓‴(𝑠𝑖𝑛(𝑥)): -1
* Calculating coefficient: ∫∫∫−1 = −1×𝑥³ / (3×2×1) + 𝑐 = −𝑥³ / 6 + 𝑐"
"Integrating this into our existing approximation, we now have: 𝑓(𝑥) = 0+𝑥−𝑥3 3! How does that look? We can see our approximation has improved again, now following the curve closely for a greater portion of the period! 79",Book 2_2036060.pdf,80,"Here are the notes on the given passage:

**Approximating a Function**
==========================

* The current approximation of the function `𝑓(𝑥)` is:
	+ `𝑓(𝑥) = 0 + 𝑥 - 𝑥³ / 3!`
* This approximation has **improved** compared to the previous one, now following the curve more closely for a larger portion of the period."
"Taylor Expansion No doubt you are starting to see a pattern and how this approximation works. Once again, the fourth derivative will evaluate to ero, so we can skip it. The fifth evaluates to 1, so we can intuitively create the next term: ∫∫∫∫∫1 =𝑥5 5!+𝑐 This changes our approximation to be: 𝑓(𝑥) = 0+𝑥−𝑥3 3!+𝑥5 5! We can also see that our approximation is even better! In fact, it would not be surprising if when looking at the graph, it takes you a moment to determine which line represents sine! What we have just arrived is a Taylor series or Taylor expansion for an approximation of sine. Since it is an infinite series, we might see it written like this: 𝑠𝑖𝑛(𝑥) = 𝑥−𝑥3 3!+𝑥5 5!−𝑥7 7!... 80",Book 2_2036060.pdf,81,"Here are the summary notes in advanced bullet-point format:

**Taylor Expansion**
=====================

### Definition
* A **Taylor series** or **Taylor expansion** is an infinite series used to approximate a function, in this case, the sine function.

### Approximation of Sine
* The Taylor expansion for sine is: `𝑠𝑖𝑛(𝑥) = 𝑥 - 𝑥³/3! + 𝑥⁵/5! - 𝑥⁷/7! ...`
* Each term is a power of `𝑥` divided by its corresponding **factorial**.

### How it Works
* Start with a function `𝑓(𝑥)` and evaluate its derivatives at a point `𝑐`.
* Use the derivatives to construct the Taylor series, which is an infinite sum of terms.
*Each term is of the form `( 𝑥 - 𝑐 )ⁿ / 𝑛!` where `𝑛` is the degree of the term.

### Advantages
* The Taylor expansion provides an **approximation** of the original function.
* The more terms used in the series, the **better the approximation**.
* In this case, the approximation of sine is surprisingly accurate, making it difficult to distinguish from the original sine curve.

Note: The Taylor expansion is not limited to the sine function and can be applied to other functions as well."
"Fourier You might be thinking to yourself that this is very cool, and perhaps even explains some things that were kind of puzzling in calculus, but what does this have to do with periodicity? You should definitely have the intuition, especially since we worked this expansion out using a periodic function, that all periodic data should have some iterative algorithm that might be used to approximate the data. While you might think that we have chosen to use trigonometric functions to lead to this intuition because they are easy expansions, there is another motivation. A mathematician by the name of Joseph Fourier discovered something very interesting while doing research in the field of thermodynamics. His research was conducted in the late 1700s, and seemed relatively unimportant at the time. More a footnote than an important discovery, it was not until much later that the power of his discovery was realized, when signals analysis became important with the advent of radio and electricity in the 19th and 20th centuries. What was this discovery? Fourier’s insight was that any periodic function can be represented as an expansion of a set of sine functions. Take that in for just a moment. It is absolutely not intuitive. Anyperiodic function can be represented as some expansion of sine. We won’t do it rigorously, but that statement does deserve some measure of proof. 81",Book 2_2036060.pdf,82,"Here are the notes in advanced bullet-point format:

"Let’s consider the case of a square wave. We can think of such a wave as the signal that is used within our computer systems as the clock signal that synchronizes all of the activities within the system. You could also think of it as an audio signal. As an audio signal, it sounds a bit like a kazoo. Can we demonstrate that such a signal, which is definitely periodic, can be built up from some set of sine waves? The Fourier expansion for a square wave is as follows: 𝑓(𝑥) =4 𝜋(𝑠𝑖𝑛(𝜔𝑡)+𝑠𝑖𝑛(3𝜔𝑡) 3+𝑠𝑖𝑛(5𝜔𝑡) 5...) 82",Book 2_2036060.pdf,83,"Here are the notes I've taken on the provided passage:

"“Sure”, you say, “Flash some fancy math at us and expect us to believe you.” Let’s consider several examples of this. In the slide, we have overlaid several examples of the expansion with different numbers of terms. If you look carefully, you can see a sine wave sitting behind all of the others. Built up on top of the sine wave, we have Fourier expansions with two, three, and four terms. You can see that even with just two terms, we have something that is far more square-like than the sine wave. Intuitively, the number of terms in the expansion works out to be the number of peaks found at either the high or the low portions of the wave. Even so, you might look at this graph and think, “That doesn’t really look square to me. Sure, it is square-ish, but square?” 83",Book 2_2036060.pdf,84,"Here are the notes in advanced bullet-point markdown format:

"To satisfy your possible disbelief, we wrote a recursive function that allows us to calculate the Fourier expansion for a square wave to any number of terms provided that the system has sufficient memory.

"It seems reasonable to assume that if it is possible to decompose any periodic function into some series or expansion of sine functions, that it might be possible to manipulate this in other ways. For example, two major components of this expansion are frequency and time. Is it possible that there is some manipulation or algebraic work that can be done that allows us to isolate the frequency? The answer to this question is yes, but it gets even better. Not only can we use this to find the frequency of a signal, we can also use this to derive a function that will find the spectrum density vector that indicates the strength of, or presence of, all periodic signals within a time domain sample of data. This sounds fine, but you might be thinking that not all of the data that we have is periodic. What happens when non-periodic data is introduced? It turns out that when we analyze the spectrum, periodic signals show up with some measure of strength, while the non-periodic data shows up as “noise”. In other words, the noise will be present in the graph, but since there is no coherent or periodic signal, its overall strength will be much lower. Thinking of this in terms of some of the statistics that we worked with earlier, the signals turn out to be outliers, and the noise is well below them. 85",Book 2_2036060.pdf,86,"**Note-Taking Summary:**

"The applications of Fourier’s work are far-ranging. Anyone who has successfully completed an Electrical Engineering degree has certainly spent time becoming familiar with the applications of this work since so much of the work of an EE is performed using the frequency domain rather than the time domain that so many other fields rely on. For us, there are some wonderful applications. We have all kinds of time series data available to us. Logs are recorded as a time series. File timestamps can be organized and viewed as time-series data. Network connections and packets can be collected and analyzed as time-series data. This means that we can potentially convert any kind of data in our environment that we can represent as a time series to a frequency domain analysis. Once in this domain, a spectral density analysis will allow us to find coherent signals in that data. Botnet beacons should become easy to find. Bot-like activities in our logs should become readily apparent. Consider this application. Often, attackers will disguise their activities by launching attacks from apparently different source addresses. This could be done by pivoting through proxies or running the attacks through something like ToR. What if we were to group data by tactics or techniques over time but disregard the source of the activity completely. Could this be used to identify periodic activities that are occurring across many sources, strongly implying that either the sources are coordinating their activity or it is a single attacker (or attacker group) disguising their activity. 86",Book 2_2036060.pdf,87,"Here are the notes on the applications of Fourier's work in the context of electrical engineering and cybersecurity:

"Discrete Fourier Transformation The primary tool that we will use for this analysis is called the Discrete Fourier Transform. It takes the form: 𝑋𝑘=𝑁−1 ∑ 𝑛=0𝑥𝑛𝑒−𝑖2𝜋𝑘𝑛 In this formula, 𝑋𝑘is the output and contains the power or strength at each discrete interval, or frequency bin, that the transformation produces. The values (𝑥0,𝑥1,𝑥2,...,𝑥𝑛)are the values at the various time intervals in the sampled data. 𝑁is the total number of samples collected. The term 𝑘represents the frequency.

"As powerful as this tool is, it does require some effort to use. It is by no means automatic. One of the big challenges is determining what the best sampling rate is to use. Our first instinct might be to use a very, very high sampling rate. This should provide the greatest granularity for frequency response (and it does), but the spectrum that it returns might be very difficult to analyze unless we are looking for high-frequency signals. If we are looking for events that happen hourly, using a sampling rate of 1 sample per second might be overly precise and make it difficult to find the hourly activity. On the other hand, there are some important bounds to be aware of. Looking, again, for a periodic signal that occurs hourly, our sampling rate must be at least1 2the frequency of the signal that we are looking for. This represents the frequency resolution. You may also see this referred to as the Nyquistrate . Expressed more directly, this value is twice the frequency of the highest frequency signal that you are seeking to find. How do we convert our existing data into something that we can use with the Discrete Fourier Transform? We define a window size, which is the time series equivalent of the bin size from histogram analysis. If we decide to use a window size of 10 seconds, we collect all of the signals that occur within that window and aggregate them in some way, perhaps through a sum or a product. We repeat this process for every 10-second window to produce the data as a complete time series with no gaps. 88",Book 2_2036060.pdf,89,"Here are the notes on the provided passage in advanced bullet-point format:

"One of the things that can be challenging is working out exactly what the output of a Discrete Fourier Transform means. While we understand that it is giving us the spectral density, or indicating which frequencies are most strongly present, how can you know which frequency a particular value refers to? NumPy provides a function to create a list of frequencies based on a Discrete Fourier Transform. The problem is that this can be, strangely, difficult to use and even more difficult to interpret. Yet, this function is trying to help us solve a very simple problem. When we use the Discrete Fourier Transform, there is a limit to the range of frequencies that can be detected. The Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem demonstrates that this range is from ero to 1 2×𝑆𝑓where𝑆𝑓is the sampling frequency. This value is known as the Nyquist frequency. Knowing this, working out which frequency is being represented turns out to be trivially simple. The Discrete Fourier Transform will produce “bins” indicating the densities. If we divide the Nyquist frequency by the number of bins, the result tells us the frequency “width” of each bin. This allows us to very simply determine the frequency of any given bin since it will contain a range of frequencies around(𝑐𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑡÷𝑆𝑓 2)×𝑏𝑖𝑛 where𝑐𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑡 is the number of bins generated and 𝑏𝑖𝑛is the bin number for which you wish to determine the frequency. 89",Book 2_2036060.pdf,90,"Here are the notes on the topic of Discrete Fourier Transform in advanced markdown format:

"Summary This book has covered a lot of ground. We have covered descriptive statistics that can be used to do some initial exploration of our data. We also examined some of the weaknesses inherent in the most commonly used methods for describing data, supplementing these weaknesses with much more robust measures. We also turned this into an interesting analysis that can quickly and easily identify encrypted or unencrypted data. We also spent time working with probability. While we have only scratched the surface of prob- ability theory, we were able to derive an exceptionally important theorem, Bayes theorem, which lies at the heart of many classification tools. Even better, we were able to implement a tool that can classify ham versus spam. While this specific tool might not be exceptionally valuable day to day, the ability to apply this technique to new problems is where the real value lies. Finally, we ended the day with some deeper mathematics.

"Clustering In this section, we will examine and experiment with the most prevalent type of Unsupervised Learning in use today: Clustering . 4",Book 3_2036060.pdf,5,"Here are the notes on Clustering:

**Clustering**
================

### Definition

* **Clustering** is a type of Unsupervised Learning, where the goal is to group similar objects or data points into clusters based on their characteristics or features.

### Objective

* The objective of clustering is to identify patterns or structures in the data that are not immediately apparent.

### Characteristics

* Clustering is based on the idea that objects within a cluster are similar to each other and are dissimilar to objects in other clusters.
* **Homogeneity** within clusters and **heterogeneity** between clusters are the guiding principles of clustering.

### Applications

* Clustering has numerous applications in various fields, including:
	+ **Data Mining**
	+ **Image Segmentation**
	+ **Customer Segmentation**
	+ **Gene Expression Analysis**
	+ **Anomaly Detection**

"Unsupervised Learning Unsupervised Learning describes the set of statistical, mathematical, and machine learning tech- niques that allow us to analyze our data without requiring that the data be labelled. Note that we are stating that labels are not required. We make that distinction because you will more typically hear it described as techniques that are used when the labels are not known. This variation of definition is useful because it allows us to see unsupervised learning techniques for what they are: Tools that we can use to further explore our data. If you are attempting to solve a problem involving anomaly detection1 It is important to take note that in the context of statistics, an anomaly represents something out of the ordinary. There is no notion of good or bad, simply an observation that the data point is unusual in some way. To put things into the context of something familiar, the data most distanced from the mean in a normal curve can be termed outliers or anomalies. Supervised Learning Supervised Learning techniques, on the other hand, are typically mathematical models that, by def- inition, require that the labels for the data are known. In fact, the matter of whether or not the labels are provided to the algorithm is the primary criteria that separate supervised from unsupervised learning methods. 1In the field of information security, anomaly detection typically refers to some process that has out-of-the-ordinary behaviors. Anomalous activities and malicious activities are not necessarily the same, though you will find that the term anomaly detection is frequently used to indicate that we are detecting malicious activities. 5",Book 3_2036060.pdf,6,"**Unsupervised Learning**
==========================

* **Definition**: Set of statistical, mathematical, and machine learning techniques that analyze data without requiring labeled data.
* **Key characteristic**: No labels are required.
* **Purpose**: Explore data, identify patterns, and detect anomalies.

**Anomaly Detection**
--------------------

* **Definition**: Identifying unusual data points that are out of the ordinary.
* **Context**: In statistics, an anomaly is not inherently good or bad, just unusual.

"While unsupervised models primarily identify similarity among the data and identify clusters, su- pervised models attempt to create a model that allows new data to be correctly mapped to an output in the same way that the training data has been. While not all supervised models produce a mathe- matical or geometric transformation function, it is certainly useful to visualize a supervised model as just such a construct. That is, a generalized function that transforms the input data into the correct output. 6",Book 3_2036060.pdf,7,"Here are the notes in advanced markdown format:

"How Clustering Works Our current topic, unsupervised learning, is primarily used to find similarities in our data. At times, these similarities are obvious even without the application of mathematics or any form of deep analysis. In cases such as these, one might question the value of the unsupervised techniques. This is, however, naïve. Even in cases where the clustering is obvious to us, these models are very powerful. Consider: When a human visualizes the data and perceives an obvious clustering, that clustering is obvious to us because of how it looks. However, translating something that we perceive visually or mentally into something that a computer can do automatically can be very tricky! Clustering algorithms are very useful, both in what appear to be trivial cases and in complex cases, because they provide us with a mathematical or statistical tool that can be used to identify and describe similarities. While we will often attempt to visualize these similarities, it is not necessary to do so; our programs can use them directly, “seeing” the clusters in a way that we might not. So far, this sounds wonderful. It might sound as though unsupervised models must be the best and easiest way to perform machine learning! This is not necessarily so. There are a number of important challenges and limitations. Generating clusters is not difficult. Understanding what the various clusters mean is far more chal- lenging. This is especially true when we take high dimensionality data and transform it down to two or three dimensions to visualize our clusters. For example, imagine that we perform some preprocessing on our log data and plug it into some clustering technique. Having done this, we find 87 different clusters. Said another way, there are 87 groupings of log data that are very similar. Taking these two steps might take a handful of minutes. 7",Book 3_2036060.pdf,8,"Here are the notes on ""How Clustering Works"" in advanced bullet-point format:

**Unsupervised Learning and Clustering**

"However, why are there 87 clusters? What makes them similar? Should there be 87 clusters? Are any of those clusters indicative of events of interest? These questions can prove to be very difficult to answer! For instance, depending on how we preprocess our data or which features in our data prove to be mathematically most interesting, it could turn out that the clusters are being formed because there are 87 different lengths of messages being generated! Or that our data represents 87 different systems! Or any of a myriad of possibilities. This brings us back to the idea of anomalies. When we form clusters, we need to think about and experiment with clusters that still allow us to identify anomalies. How different must something be before we view it as an anomaly that we should be informed about? Also, how can we discriminate between something that is simply noise and something that is an event of interest? The unfortunate answer is lots of trial and error. 8",Book 3_2036060.pdf,9,"Here are the notes on the topic of clustering and anomaly detection:

"Consider the three-dimensional scatter plot in the slide. To generate this graph, we took a set of 14-dimensional data that describes network data. After some preprocessing, we extracted only data involving TCP port 221Once the data was extracted, we plugged the data into a clustering algorithm and projected the clusters down to three dimensions. Within the graph, you can see that there is a dense cluster of points very close to the origin, which is the lower left-hand corner of the graph. The large gray sphere that contains the majority of the points is centered on the center of the cluster of the data. The radius of the sphere is completely arbitrary. We generated this arbitrary radius sphere to create a simple demarkation between points that tightly cluster and points that appear to be anomalous. Now that you have the lay of the land, consider this important question: Which points indicate malicious activity? It would be wonderful if we could firmly state that all of the points outside of the gray sphere represent malicious activity, but things are not nearly so simple. Similarly, it would be wonderful if we knew that everything inside of the sphere is an event of interest. To understand what the clusters really mean, we need to have some measure of domain knowledge. We must also go back to the data and seek to understand why the data clusters in the way that it does. Which dimensions in our data proved to be most significant mathematically? What do the axes represent? What if we told you that the tight cluster in the bottom left corner represents many hundreds of failed logon attempts that are the result of brute force password attempts?

"interesting, but it also makes us far more curious about the anomalies. Could some of the anomalies represent legitimate administration activities? It makes sense that these would not cluster tightly with the failed logon attempts since these connections would have different characteristics. However, this gives rise to another possibility. Is it possible that some, maybe even most, of the anomalies represent attackers who have successfully guessed a password? This could certainly be the case! There is no way to know based solely on the clustering. 10",Book 3_2036060.pdf,11,"Here are the notes in advanced bullet-point format:

"Correlations Clustering techniques can be useful in and of themselves. When applying data science and ma- chine learning tools to the field of information security, clustering tools are especially useful as data exploration tools. One of the things that these tools do is help us to understand how different features within our data are related to one another. A key tool that we use to find these relationships are techniques that reveal correlations between features. Understanding these correlations can go a long way to understanding what our customers are telling us. Correlations can also be very powerful tools when it comes to determining which data should be used to generate clusters. Just because features are correlated does not mean that those features should be represented in our results. While it might be true that both features are useful, it might also mean that only one of them needs to be represented. It might even be true that neither of the features that are correlated matter for the particular problem we’re trying to solve. Pictured in the slide above, we can see an example of a heat map applied to a correlation matrix. We will look at how this is produced more closely in our lab, but what it is attempting to illustrate is how strongly each pair of features within our data are correlated. 11",Book 3_2036060.pdf,12,"**Correlations and Clustering Techniques in Information Security**

"What we are saying is that just because data is correlated doesn’t mean that the data is interesting or that the correlation itself is interesting. Let’s consider a few examples. Let’s imagine that we are examining network communication on a network. How would you expect the number of bytes that are transmitted to be related to the number of packets that are sent? Com- pare two connections, one that sent only a few bytes and another that sent a large number of bytes. Would you expect that the difference in the number of packets sent in each varies in a way that is proportional to the number of bytes sent? This assumption seems completely reasonable. This is an example of a correlation. Continuing to think about this example, finding a large number of packets with a large number of bytes would not be very interesting. On the other hand, finding a very large number of packets without a commensurately large number of bytes would be interesting. This would represent an anomaly in our data since the specific point does not follow the typical correlation. For us, this would likely be an event of interest. Just because the event is interesting, however, doesn’t mean that it is bad. How could this situation arise? There are several possibilities. One possibility could be a series of probes sent between one host and another. These probes could take the form of a scan or some other potentially malicious activity. However, another possibility is that this is indicative of a long- term connection over which no data is being sent. Perhaps the only packets that are present are “keepalives”1. The longer the connection continues, the larger the number of keepalives sent, none 1In network communication, a keepalive is a packet that is sent periodically, typically once every 60 seconds, to prevent any intermediate firewalls from assuming that the connection has ended and dropping the connection from its state table. TCP connections can persist for any arbitrary length of time even if no packets or data are being transferred. Firewalls, however, having a finite amount of memory dedicated to tracking connections, will drop stale connections that have gone silent. The keepalive prevents this from happening, allowing the connection to continue even when no data is present. 12",Book 3_2036060.pdf,13,"**Correlation vs. Interestingness**
=====================================

### Correlation does not imply interestingness

* Just because data is correlated, it doesn't mean the correlation is interesting or the data is interesting
* Example: Number of bytes transmitted vs. number of packets sent in network communication
	+ Correlation is expected: more bytes transmitted = more packets sent
	+ **But**, finding a large number of packets with a large number of bytes is not interesting
	+ Finding a large number of packets without a commensurate number of bytes is interesting (anomaly)

### Anomalies can be interesting
-------------------------

* An anomaly can be an event of interest, but it doesn't mean it's bad
* Possibilities for the anomaly:
	+ Series of probes (scans or potentially malicious activity)
	+ Long-term connection with no data being sent, using **keepalives**
		- **Keepalive**: packet sent periodically to prevent firewalls from dropping the connection

"of which contain any application data. Is a long-term connection with no data interesting? Maybe. Could this be an attacker that has set up a remote C21channel? Certainly! However, this could also be a completely normal connection between two systems that just happens to be silent. 1C2 is a common abbreviation for ”Command and Control” connections. While we may hear this term and imme- diately assume that they are malicious, this term would also apply to an administrator remotely controlling a system using normal administrative channels and tools. 13",Book 3_2036060.pdf,14,"Here are my notes on the passage in advanced bullet-point markdown format:

"Returning to the idea of clustering and correlations, all of this means that clustering is simply iden- tifying data within our sample that behaves similarly. This is usually accomplished by looking for correlations of some kind. These fall into a few categories: •APositive Correlation indicates that two features within our data vary in the same way rel- ative to one another. For example, imagine we are thinking about the grades that a sample of students achieve on an exam. We collect a great many facts about each student and their study habits. These include things like the student’s age, the student’s height, the student’s weight, the amount of time the students sleep each night, and the amount of time they spend studying. When we attempt to perform a correlation between each of these pairs of features, we discover that a student’s grade tends to be higher relative to the number of hours spent studying. Certainly, this is not a surprising relationship. This would also be an example of a positive correlation if an increased number of hours results in an increased exam score. The relationship need not be one to one; we are simply observing that when one value increases, so does the other. •ANegative Correlation means that there is an apparent relationship between two attributes, but that as one value increases, the other decreases. Consider this example. We gather data concerning wines and the grapes that are used to produce them. Included in our features are things like the strength of the flavor, the body of the wine, the amount of rainfall that year, the size of the grapes, and more. When analyzing the data we discover an apparent correlation. A greater amount of rainfall results in a lower quality flavor. The two values appear to be correlated, but in this case when one value increases, the other one decreases by some relative amount. •It is also possible that we discovered the two values are completely unrelated, and that lack of relationship is somehow interesting to us. Perhaps we assume that the two values should be 14",Book 3_2036060.pdf,15,"Here are the notes on clustering and correlations in advanced bullet-point markdown format:

* Two features vary in the same way relative to each other

* Relationship doesn't need to be one-to-one; increasing one value leads to an increase in the other

### **Negative Correlation**
* Two attributes have an apparent relationship, but one value increases while the other decreases

"related, or at least they seem that they ought to be. This lack of correlation can be interesting from the perspective of data exploration because we have learned something about our data.

"K-Means Clustering How then can we cluster our data? There are several different techniques. We will look specifically at two and begin with the K-Means approach. First, let’s break down the name. The Kin K-Means refers to some arbitrary number of clusters that will be found within our data. The “Means” portion of the name has to do with the fact that the algorithm is effectively attempting to find the points that best represent the mean of each cluster. The K-Means algorithm can be expressed mathematically as: 𝐽 (𝑉 ) =𝑐 ∑ 𝑖=1𝑐𝑖 ∑ 𝑗=1(‖𝑥𝑖− 𝑣𝑗‖)2 Let’s translate this. The expression ‖𝑥𝑖− 𝑣𝑗‖represents the Euclidian distance1between two points. In this case, those points represent the position of 𝑥𝑖, the coordinates of the 𝑖𝑡ℎdata point 𝑥, and the coordinate of the 𝑗𝑡ℎcentroid2𝑣. 1Euclidian distance sounds complex, but it is something that you are almost certainly familiar with. This represents the measured distance between two points. If you recall the Pythagorean theorem taught in basic Geometry, you know that we can calculate the length of the hypotenuse of a triangle by calculating √𝑥2+ 𝑦2. If we apply this to two arbitrary points on a Cartesian plane, we can generalize this to √(𝑥1− 𝑥2)2+ (𝑦1− 𝑦2)2, which gives the distance between those two points. This is a two-dimensional example of the Euclidian distance . 2Acentroid is a point around which other points are centered. In the case of K-Means clustering, this would be the center point in some arbitrary 𝑛dimensional space that represents the center of a specific cluster. 16",Book 3_2036060.pdf,17,"Here are the notes on K-Means Clustering in advanced bullet-point markdown format:

**K-Means Clustering**
=====================

### Definition

* **K-Means**: a clustering technique that identifies **K** (arbitrary number) of clusters within the data, where each cluster is represented by its mean ( centroid )

### Mathematically Expressed

* **K-Means Algorithm**: `𝐽 (𝑉 ) = 𝑐 ∑ 𝑖=1𝑐𝑖 ∑ 𝑗=1(‖𝑥𝑖− 𝑣𝑗‖)2`
	+ `‖𝑥𝑖− 𝑣𝑗‖`: **Euclidian Distance** between two points
	+ `𝑥𝑖`: coordinates of the ith data point
	+ `𝑣𝑗`: coordinates of the jth centroid

### Euclidian Distance

* **Euclidian Distance**: measured distance between two points
	+ Calculated using the **Pythagorean Theorem**: `√(𝑥1− 𝑥2)2+ (𝑦1− 𝑦2)2`
	+ Generalized form for **n-dimensional space**

### Centroid

* **Centroid**: a point around which other points are centered
	+ In K-Means clustering, represents the center point in **n-dimensional space** that represents the center of a specific cluster"
"Note that the expression calls for us to square the Euclidian distance. This conveniently prevents us from having to calculate what might prove to be a very unpleasant square root, which is the final step in the Euclidian distance calculation. With these elements in hand, we can look back at the nested summation symbols. This entire ex- pression calculates the sum of the distances of all of the points from each of the centroids. The goal in K-Means is to minimize this total. How do we minimize this sum? By randomly selecting arbitrary points, performing the overall calculation, and then adjusting the points some arbitrary number of times in an effort to find the centroids for which the entire expression produces the lowest value. 17",Book 3_2036060.pdf,18,"Here are the advanced bullet-point notes summarizing the important parts of the passage:

**K-Means Algorithm**
======================

**Note:** The goal of K-Means is to **minimize the total sum of distances** between points and centroids.

**Key Concepts:**

* **Euclidian Distance**: The distance between two points in n-dimensional space.
* **Centroids**: The central points of clusters in K-Means.

**Calculation:**

* The expression calculates the **sum of distances** of all points from each centroid.
* This is done by squaring the Euclidian distance to avoid calculating the square root.

**Minimizing the Sum:**

* Randomly select arbitrary points as centroids.
* Perform the overall calculation.
* Adjust the points multiple times to find the centroids that produce the **lowest total sum**.

**Objective:**
The goal is to find the centroids that minimize the total sum of distances, ensuring that the points are clustered optimally."
"So far so good. The formula looks complicated, but understanding the pieces we can see that it’s not that hard. There does remain a problem, however. When we define a Euclidean distance in a 2-D or 3-D space1we can easily visualize what that means. What would this mean in a six-dimensional space? It turns out that the distance formula translates directly. For example: √𝑖2+ 𝑗2+ 𝑘2+ 𝑙2+ 𝑚2+ 𝑛2 This represents the Euclidean distance formula for a six-dimensional ( ℝ6) space. However, what does this distance mean? We cannot even imagine what a six-dimensional surface might look like since it is well beyond our experience. This can result in a distance that seems quite small even though the data comprising those points is quite different. Let’s illustrate this in a way that might make more sense. If we think about things in a two- dimensional space, we know that the shortest distance between two points is a straight line. This is perfect a perfect application of the Euclidian distance. If you have ever worked with geography, or higher order services in calculus, then you are likely aware that the shortest distance between two points on a sphere is not a straight line. Instead, it is what we call a great circle, which is effectively a curved three-dimensional line. In other words, the Euclidean distance is not actually the best mea- sure in all cases. We can say, as a rule of thumb, the more dimensions you have, the less useful the Euclidean distance calculation becomes. 1While we will not use this notation in these books, it seems worth mentioning that the typical notation indicating the dimensionality of the space in which we are examining data would be ℝ2for two-dimensional space or ℝ3for three-dimensional space. This notation can be used for any number of dimensions, potentially written as ℝ𝑛. 18",Book 3_2036060.pdf,19,"Here are the notes in advanced bullet-point format:

**Euclidean Distance Formula in Higher Dimensions**
======================================================

* The Euclidean distance formula can be applied to higher-dimensional spaces, but its meaning becomes unclear.
* In a 2D or 3D space, the formula is easily understood, but in a 6D space, it's difficult to visualize and understand.
* The Euclidean distance formula for a 6D space is: √𝑖2+ 𝑗2+ 𝑘2+ 𝑙2+ 𝑚2+ 𝑛2

**Limitations of Euclidean Distance**
-----------------------------------

* In higher dimensions (e.g., 6D), the Euclidean distance can be misleading, as small distances may not necessarily mean similar data points.
* The formula is not always the best measure, especially in cases where the shortest distance between two points is not a straight line (e.g., on a sphere).

**Important Concepts**
--------------------

* *Euclidean distance*: a measure of the straight-line distance between two points in a multidimensional space.
* *Higher-dimensional space*: a space with more than three dimensions, where visualization becomes difficult.
* *ℝn*: notation for an n-dimensional space (e.g., ℝ2 for 2D, ℝ3 for 3D, etc.)."
"How can we combat this problem? One way would be to come up with a different definition for distance. There are different techniques and different functions that can be used to do so. Yet, before we were to undertake something like this, it might make a lot more sense to simply determine whether or not the dimensionality of our data can be reduced. There are a number of techniques that we can use to accomplish this. Some are algorithmic, some are based on correlation, and the simplest are based on domain knowledge. Consider our previous example of packets versus bytes. If we determined that the packets and bytes increase relatively, or are positively correlated, we may come to the conclusion that we can safely discard either the bytes or the packets from our data set. Thus, we have removed one of the dimen- sions and accomplished dimensionality reduction. We could arrive at this choice by performing a correlation analysis or by thinking about it using our domain knowledge. However, that domain knowledge might also inform us that there could be cases where these two values do not track each other. We would want to preserve this information in our analysis. But how can we do this? What if we were to create some kind of function that we use to combine the number of bytes and number of packets? If we can come up with such a function, we can then combine these two attributes into a single attribute that’s reducing dimensionality without completely ignoring one of our features. It does make sense to do this to some degree. However, when we are dealing with a large number of dimensions, we may need to do something more aggressive and reputable. How can we remove the need to have deep domain understanding? Principal Component Analysis is just such a mathe- matical tool that allows us to put accomplish dimensionality reduction based on the facts of the data itself. 19",Book 3_2036060.pdf,20,"Here are the advanced bullet-point notes summarizing the important parts of the passage:

"Principal Component Analysis & Linear Algebra Principal Component Analysis is a tool that comes to us from the field of Linear Algebra. Shortly, we are going to take a brief detour into Linear Algebra and some fundamental principles of it so that we can better understand how principal component analysis functions. This detour will prove to be valuable for other aspects of our course that come later. Most of the algorithms that are used for supervised machine learning today rely heavily on linear algebra. While we will not be doing any of the calculations manually, it is very valuable for us to understand the fundamentals of the tools that we will be using. This basis allows us to develop a better intuitive understanding of what’s happening “under the hood” in our machine learning tools. Before we do so, let’s explain what PCA1can help us to do. Consider the two images on the slide. Both of these pictures are of the author’s wife. It is unlikely that you can see any difference between these two images. However, one image is over 5 MB and the other is just a few hundred kilobytes. What was changed? One of the images is the full-resolution image produced by the digital camera. The second image has had its color space reduced and has also been resized to be at a much lower resolution. Why can’t we see the difference? There are a few reasons. Consider, first, the resolution. The full resolution image would require a photographic print approx- imately 20 inches high to produce. Since we are looking at the image in a much smaller space, we can discard large numbers of pixels as irrelevant since we can’t see them at this lower resolution. Now let’s think about the color. Surely reducing the color space will severely degrade the image! While this is true, it turns out that the ability of our eye to discriminate one color from another is 1PCA is the typical abbreviation for Principal Component Analysis 20",Book 3_2036060.pdf,21,"Here are the notes on Principal Component Analysis and Linear Algebra in advanced bullet-point markdown format:

==================================================================================

### Introduction
* Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a tool from Linear Algebra
* Understanding Linear Algebra is crucial for supervised machine learning algorithms

### Importance of Linear Algebra
* Most machine learning algorithms rely heavily on Linear Algebra
* Understanding the fundamentals of Linear Algebra provides a better intuitive understanding of machine learning tools

### What PCA can help with
* **Data Compression**: reducing the size of an image while preserving its quality
* **Dimensionality Reduction**: reducing the number of features in a dataset while retaining important information

### Example: Image Compression
* **Full-resolution image** vs. **compressed image**
	+ Full-resolution image: high resolution, large file size (5 MB)
	+ Compressed image: lower resolution, smaller file size (few hundred kilobytes)
* Why can't we see the difference?
	+ **Resolution**: full-resolution image requires a large print to display all pixels, but at a lower resolution, many pixels can be discarded as irrelevant
	+ **Color space reduction**: human eyes have limited color discrimination, so reducing color space doesn't significantly degrade the image"
"much lower than our ability to discern varying shades of gray. The result? Even though one of the images has more variations and gradations of color, our eye is simply unable to discern the differences. No doubt, if we were to oom in very closely to the image and examine the pixels side by side between the images, we would be able to detect some of these color differences. However, when taken as a whole, the images are virtually indistinguishable. To be clear, this is not PCA, it’s just an illustration. However, the goal of PCA is effectively the same. That is, to allow us to identify features that could be safely compressed such that the most important features are retained with a high degree of accuracy. 21",Book 3_2036060.pdf,22,"Here are the notes on the passage in advanced bullet-point format:

"The name of this branch of mathematics, Linear Algebra, can make us mistakenly believe that this must be about the algebra of lines. This is not the case. Linear Algebra is considered to be a foundational branch of mathematics. In a sense, it is a basic approach toward mathematics that many other branches of mathematics and other fields that make heavy use of mathematics rely upon. For this reason, we should have at least a fundamental understanding of some of the principles within this field. Linear Algebra is a branch of mathematics that is primarily concerned with how things can be transformed. We do not want to confuse this with Calculus, which can be viewed as the mathematics of change. In fact, we can make use of Calculus principles within Linear Algebra and Linear Algebra principles within Calculus. Each of these branches of mathematics simply provide us with tools that can be used to manipulate numbers and systems of equations. Linear Algebra is fundamentally about the transformation of one thing into another. These trans- formations can be represented as a series of operations that are performed on values, each of which results in some linear1transformation. You may also see Linear Algebra described is being all about “Change in Basis.” Fundamentally, this is identical to describing it as the mathematics of linear transformations or translations. Changing the basis2is the result of applying some linear transformation or translation. Consider the example on the slide. Here we have a scalar3being multiplied by a matrix4 1Linear meaning straight line. 2We will simply define this to be the unit vector for some number space. 3Scalar values are integers or floating point values. We can think of a scalar value as a value that can scale another. For example, if we multiply 2 × 10 , we are doubling 10, or scaling it by a factor of 2. 4A matrix is a grid of values. More generally, a matrix is comprised of vectors (or represents a vector), which is any ordered list of values. Depending on your mathematics or science background, you may think about these in different ways. Physics students usually think of them as a force with a direction. A cartographic view makes us think of them 22",Book 3_2036060.pdf,23,"Here are the notes on Linear Algebra in advanced bullet-point markdown format:

"2 × [0 0 2 1] = [0 0 4 2] What does this all mean? Consider the graphs displayed. If we consider the first matrix to be a matrix representing the coordinates for a line that extends from the origin at (0, 0) to the point (2, 1) , we can understand that we are attempting to make that line twice its length. We are accomplishing this by multiplying each of the values in each of the coordinates by 2. The resulting matrix shows that our new line is still starting at (0, 0) but it now extends to (4, 2) . It is twice as long. If you look closely at the graphs, you can see that the scale of the graph has changed. Thinking about this geometrically is often more intuitive than looking at the numbers directly. What we are looking at is scalar multiplication , which works just as we might intuitively assume: 2 × [0 0 2 1] = [2 × 0 2 × 0 2 × 4 2 × 2] = [0 0 4 2] as a position and a heading, possibly including a speed. A mathematician tends to think of them as a set of coordinates defining some point in some 𝑛-dimensional space. 23",Book 3_2036060.pdf,24,"Here are the notes in advanced bullet-point markdown format:

**Scalar Multiplication**
=========================

### Definition
* **Scalar multiplication**: a mathematical operation that changes the magnitude of a vector (line segment) by a scalar value
* In this case, the scalar value is 2, which doubles the length of the line segment

### Example
* Original matrix representing a line segment from (0, 0) to (2, 1):
	+ `[0 0 2 1]`
* Applying scalar multiplication by 2:
	+ `2 × [0 0 2 1] = [2 × 0 2 × 0 2 × 2 2 × 1] = [0 0 4 2]`
	+ Resulting matrix represents a line segment from (0, 0) to (4, 2), which is twice as long as the original

### Geometric Interpretation
* **Intuitive understanding**: thinking about scalar multiplication geometrically can be more intuitive than looking at the numbers directly
* **Changes in scale**: the scale of the graph changes after applying scalar multiplication

### Mathematical Perspective
* From a mathematician's perspective, vectors (line segments) can be thought of as:
	+ A set of coordinates defining a point in **n-dimensional space**
	+ Representing a position and a heading, possibly including a speed"
"Let’s try another transformation. This time, we will use a transformation matrix1to transform a point, rotating that point around the origin. This transformation is useful to consider because of the prejudice that results from hearing the name “Linear Algebra.” We are about to rotate something, which doesn’t really feel like something that involves lines since it will involve sines, cosines, and angles. However, when we write this out as a vector representing the point that we wish to rotate and define the rotation using a transformation matrix, this is absolutely a linear transformation! If we wish to rotate a point around the origin, the mathematics of it work as follows: 𝑥′= 𝑥cos 𝜃 − 𝑦 sin 𝜃𝑦′= 𝑦cos 𝜃 + 𝑥 sin 𝜃 If you have worked with Linear Algebra in the past, then you likely remember that we can use it to solve systems of equations. While this is typically introduced and taught in what might seem to be a separate application of Linear Algebra, in reality it isn’t. We are still just performing a series of transformations. For example, let’s define the transpose function as follows: 𝑋 = [ 2 1 ] ∴X⊤= [2 1] With the point 𝑋transposed from a row vector2to acolumn vector3, we now have a vector of the 1In reality, any time we multiply a vector or a matrix, we are performing a transformation. One of the things that often leads to confusion for students new to this branch of mathematics is that the geometric view of this isn’t introduced until much later, or the material is presented in such a way that geometric transformations and other matrix operations seem to be entirely different things. In reality, they are identical! All matrix operations result in a transformation; thus all matrices can be viewed as transformation matrices. 2A vector in which all of the terms appear in a single row from left to right. 3A vector in which all terms appear in a single column from top to bottom. 24",Book 3_2036060.pdf,25,"Here are the notes in advanced bullet-point format:

"proper shape1to use in a matrix multiplication2operation with a 2 × 2 transformation matrix that will rotate the point around the origin. [cos 𝜃 − sin 𝜃 sin 𝜃cos 𝜃] × [2 1] = [2 × 0.52 − 0.85 2 × 0.85 + 0.52] = [0.19 2.22] You might be wondering what just happened there. How did that operation between a 1 × 2 and a 2 × 2 matrix give that result? This comes down to the definition of matrix multiplication, which is accomplished through the dot products of the vectors that compose the matrices. A derivation of this function is well beyond the scope of this course, but suffice to say that with just a bit of algebra, we can show that the method employed for calculating the dot products is really just a clever way of simplifying multiple steps into a simple operation. Matrix multiplication using dot products is defined as follows: ⎡⎢ ⎣𝑎 𝑏 𝑐 𝑑 𝑒 𝑓 𝑔 ℎ 𝑥⎤⎥ ⎦⋅⎡⎢ ⎣𝑖 𝑗 𝑘⎤⎥ ⎦=⎡⎢ ⎣𝑖 × 𝑎 + 𝑗 × 𝑏 + 𝑘 × 𝑐 𝑖 × 𝑑 + 𝑗 × 𝑒 + 𝑘 × 𝑓 𝑖 × 𝑔 + 𝑗 × ℎ + 𝑘 × 𝑥⎤⎥ ⎦ Notice that this requires that the number of columns in the first vector must match the number of rows in the second. While our example demonstrates this using a square matrix as the first matrix, this term can have any number of rows and columns from 1 to 𝑛. From one point of view, it might appear that this operation is collapsing the 3 × 3 matrix to a 1 × 3 matrix. Certainly, this is a valid viewpoint. However, it is better to think of this in terms of transforming a matrix. For this reason, we will take the view that this operation is transforming a point in space ℝ3represented by the 3 × 1 vector in some way and that the 3 × 3 matrix is a transformation matrix. In this specific case, this 3 × 3 matrix is the transformation matrix that will rotate an arbitrary ℝ3 point around the origin using angle 𝜃. 1We speak of vectors as having a shape , which is the number of elements along each axis. For example, [3 4 0 5 ]represents a row vector with shape 1 × 4 since it has one row with four columns. 2Matrix multiplication is a bit more complex than scalar multiplication or the multiplication of a scalar with a vector (or matrix). We will detail the operation in the main body of the text. Matrix multiplication is performed by calculating thedot product of the rows and columns of two matrices. You will find in this course that we will refer to this simply as the dot product in this course. To be absolutely clear, however, the dot product produces a scalar value. This operation is used within the matrix multiplication operation. 25",Book 3_2036060.pdf,26,"Here are the notes in advanced bullet-point format:

"At this point, you might be questioning the value of representing what seems to be a simple geomet- ric or, really, trigonometric problem in a more complex way. After all, isn’t this just the same math expressed in a different (possibly more complicated) way? Sure. But there are some big advantages to this. The first is related to the fundamental idea underlying Linear Algebra: We can represent absolutely any translation or transformation as a single set of matrix operations. In fact, there’s a much deeper insight here. Any series of transformations can be simplified to a single transformation matrix. Now that is big. In other words, if we want to scale, skew, rotate, and relocate some ℝ𝑛object in any 𝑛dimensional space, rather than perform each of those sequentially all of those operations can be combined into a single matrix. Again, that’s huge, but it gets even better. Not only can we combine all of the transformations into a single matrix, we can combine all of the vectors representing the things that we wish to transform into a single matrix as well! For example, consider this matrix: [0 0 2 1] This matrix represents the composition of the point (0, 0) and (2, 1) as a single matrix of values. Previously, we rotated the point 2, 1around the origin. What if we had some matrix of points, perhaps of shape 8 × 3 , representing the coordinates of the corners of a cube in ℝ3? We are now treating the cube as a single matrix. So what? Let’s again consider the simpler example. If we transpose the transformation matrix so that the correct trigonometric functions and algebra will be performed by the dot product, we arrive at: 26",Book 3_2036060.pdf,27,"Here are the notes on the topic in advanced markdown format:

"[0 0 2 1] ⋅ [cos 𝜃sin 𝜃 −sin 𝜃cos 𝜃] If we select some angle 𝜃we can perform the transformation of both points in the line simulta- neously! This is one of the reasons that Linear Algebra is so incredibly important in the field of computer science. If we can represent a problem in terms of matrix operations, we have a highly parallelizable problem allowing us to solve multiple problems simultaneously, whether that is oc- curring in multiple threads, multiple cores on a single system, or across multiple cores in multiple systems. If you think about it, this is at the heart of the Map portion of MapReduce . In case you don’t realize this intuitively, this ability to parallelize things is bigger than it might first seem. Let’s think about this as a computer graphics problem for a moment, since that is a familiar and relatable context. Imagine that we have a number of objects that are located throughout some scene. All of those objects are represented by matrices containing the coordinates for the vertices. What we’d like to do is render that scene in a view. To do this, we need to translate all of those vertices, mapping them into the correct viewpoint for the camera. The naïve approach would be to attempt to translate each object and its vertices individually. You might imagine a loop that traverses the list of all objects, progressively rotating, scaling, and transforming each set of vertices. However, using the ideas that we just examined, we can create a single matrix that contains all of the vertices for all of the objects and transform them all simultaneously using a single transformation matrix! 27",Book 3_2036060.pdf,28,"Here are the notes in advanced bullet-point format with bolded vocabulary terms and key concepts:

"Figure 1: Possible Axis of Rotation in 3d Scatter PlotIt’s time that we bring this back to dimension- ality reduction and PCA. How are these things related to what we’ve just talked about? Con- sider the image in figure 1. Let’s imagine for a moment that the diagonal line that extends from (0, 0, 0) to(2, 1, 2) repre- sents a series of points found within that dataset. What happens if we use that line as the axis of rotation (rather than using the 𝑥,𝑦, or 𝑧axes)? Any points that sit on that line would remain un- changed. The further any given point is relative to that axis, the more that point will change as a result of the transformation. Since the values on that line do not change, they really need not be considered during the trans- formation. This is very similar to something that we did previously. When we first illus- trated rotating a line, we observed that one of the points was at (0, 0) and that any rotation (or skew or scaling) of that point in a Cartesian plane would be trivial since the point would not change. Really, then, couldn’t we just ignore that point completely? In a similar way, let’s imagine that we could identify features, or dimensions, within our data that, 28",Book 3_2036060.pdf,29,"Here are the notes in advanced bullet-point markdown format:

### Relationship to Rotation in 3D Scatter Plot
* Consider a diagonal line in a 3D scatter plot (Figure 1) as a new axis of rotation
* Points on this line remain unchanged, while points farther from the line change more during transformation
* **Rotation Invariance**: similar to rotating a line in 2D, where points on the axis of rotation (e.g., (0,0)) don't change

### Analogy to Ignoring Points in Cartesian Plane
* Recall that rotating a point at (0,0) in a Cartesian plane is trivial, as it doesn't change
* Similarly, **ignoring features or dimensions** in our data that don't change during transformation (like points on the diagonal line) can simplify the analysis

"when transformed, experience no change. Might it be possible to ignore those points as inconse- quential? If we did so, we would be reducing the dimensionality of the problem by selecting features that could be safely ignored. 29",Book 3_2036060.pdf,30,"Here are the notes on the topic:

**Feature Selection**
=====================

* **Materials that transform experience no change**: Can be considered inconsequential
* **Dimensionality Reduction**: Ignore certain features to reduce problem complexity
	+ **Selecting features**: Focus on crucial features, ignoring those that have no significant impact"
"Choosing to ignore features, however, is risky. We have the real potential to exclude a feature that turns out to be important in some circumstances. This is why domain expertise is so important. We need to think not just about the general case but about the edge cases. To translate this, while we are trying to think of things in terms of the general case with lots of data, we realize that our data will rarely (if ever) include an example of every possible outcome. After all, if we could do this, there would be little need to create any form of predictive model since all outcomes would be known and easily quantifiable. As a result, our generalization can lead us to inadvertently exclude important specific cases that our domain knowledge can inform us of. To boil this all down, what we are saying is that, much as we did with the photograph previously, we are losing precision when we engage in dimensionality reduction. Our goal is to reduce the dimen- sionality in such a way as to preserve the most important features most accurately, only sacrificing precision in less important features. Preferably, we would like to preserve these less important fea- tures to some degree, though we recognize that we will not be able to reconstitute them perfectly, just as when we reduce the resolution of an image the pixels that are averaged together to create the reduced resolution are simply gone. With this caveat in mind, then, let’s continue forward (and back) to PCA. 30",Book 3_2036060.pdf,31,"Here are the notes in advanced bullet-point format:

* **Limitations of general case thinking**: Focusing on the general case can lead to ignoring specific, important cases that domain knowledge can inform us about.

"PCA seeks to find the two features within our data that have the greatest degree of covariance . While this is a new term for us, it is actually another way of saying something that we have already discussed; we are attempting to quantify a correlation value between the two dimensions or features. Figure 2: Heatmap of a Covariance MatrixWe did not provide a rigorous definition of cor- relation previously. We were relying on your familiarity with the word to create an intuition for you. That intuition is likely accurate. Cor- relation is seeking to identify that two variables are somehow related to each other. Mathemat- ically, correlation is defined in terms of covari- ance. Several pages ago, we looked at the cor- relation matrix pictured here in figure 2. Acorrelation matrix and a covariance matrix are the same things. Let’s define covariance a bit more formally. Thecovariance is a value between -1.0 and 1.0 that represents the degree to which two values are dependent. The more positive the value, the more positively correlated the values are. The more negative the value, the more negatively correlated the values are. As a corollary, the closer the covariance value is to ero, the less related they are. If the covariance value is ero, the two values are independent1. 1Simply meaning that they are not correlated or dependent in any way and vary independently within the problem 31",Book 3_2036060.pdf,32,"Here are the notes on PCA, covariance, and correlation in advanced bullet-point format:

Within each plot, we then determine the centroid2and then measure the variance from that centroid (mean squared distance) for each point in the plot.

"Putting what we just talked about on hold, let’s come back to the idea of transformation matrices. As it turns out, many (not all) square matrices have special transformation matrices associated with them that are known as eigenvectors . If you have taken Linear Algebra previously, you are likely cringing as you read that. Just hold on. We are going to attempt to provide you with a very useful and intuitive understanding of what eigenvectors andeigenvalues are really all about. Consider the following matrix multiplication: [2 3 2 1] ⋅ [3 2] = [12 8] = 4 × [3 2] What’s happening here? When we transform this 2 × 2 square matrix with this specific 1 × 2 matrix, we end up with a new 1 × 2 matrix that is exactly four times larger than the original transformation matrix. In fact, this means that the matrix calculation on the left is equivalent to the scalar multipli- cation on the right. There’s no obvious reason whythis is true. Additionally, we are not interested in working out a way to determine which vectors have this special property for any given square matrix. For us, it is sufficient to know that they exist. But why? First, take note that when we perform the matrix multiplication or dot product using one of these, the result is the same matrix scaled by some amount (which can be bigger or smaller, positive or negative). We point this out because the prefix eigen tends to make this sound very difficult. For now, we will just point out that this word can be translated from German to mean own. This makes some sense since applying this transformation to a matrix for which it is an eigenvector simply results in a scaled copy of its own self. By the way, this eigenvector has an eigenvalue of 4. Do you have an intuition as to why this is the case? Notice that when we multiply by this eigenvector, the result is the same as a scalar multiplication by four. Therefore, the eigenvalue of the eigenvector is four. 33",Book 3_2036060.pdf,34,"Here are the notes on eigenvectors and eigenvalues in advanced markdown format:

**Eigenvectors and Eigenvalues**
=============================

**Definition**
---------------

* Eigenvectors: special transformation matrices associated with square matrices
* Eigenvalues: scalar values corresponding to eigenvectors

**Example**
---------

* Matrix multiplication: `[2 3; 2 1] ⋅ [3 2] = [12 8] = 4 × [3 2]`
* The resulting matrix is scaled by a factor of 4, equivalent to scalar multiplication

**Properties**
-------------

* Eigenvectors: when transformed by the associated matrix, result in a scaled copy of themselves
* Eigenvalues: scalar values representing the amount of scaling
* **Eigenvector-eigenvalue pair**: an eigenvector with its corresponding eigenvalue (e.g., `[3 2]` with eigenvalue 4)

**Intuition**
-------------

* The prefix ""eigen"" means ""own"" in German, reflecting the idea that eigenvectors transform into scaled copies of themselves
* Eigenvalues represent the amount of scaling in this transformation process

"How does this help us with PCA? Let us provide you with a few more facts. First, as we said, not all matrices will have eigenvectors. One prerequisite is that only square matrices can have eigenvectors. Even then, not all square matrices will have eigenvectors. Why not? And what does it mean when they do? We are nearly there. Before we answer those questions, another fact. If a square matrix has one eigenvector, then it must have the same number of eigenvectors as it as dimensions. In other words, if we have a 3 × 3 matrix for which we discover one eigenvector, that matrix must have two additional eigenvectors for a total of three. It cannot have one. It cannot have two. It cannot have four, or any number greater than three. If it has any, it must have three. Similarly, a 5 × 5 matrix, if it has one eigenvector, it must have five. 34",Book 3_2036060.pdf,35,"Here are the notes on the passage about PCA (Principal Component Analysis) and eigenvectors:

"Not only must a matrix with eigenvectors have the same number of eigenvectors as it has dimensions, each of those eigenvectors is orthoganal1to the others. If you think about that for a moment, you will realize why a 3 × 3 matrix cannot have four (or more) eigenvectors. This property turns out to be incredibly useful. Do you remember that we stated that the fundamental idea behind Linear Algebra is the transformation of data in terms of a change in basis? Eigenvectors provide an incredibly important tool in this regard when it comes to dimensionality reduction. What if we were to use the eigenvectors as the change in basis, using them as a set of axes around which we could transform our data? 1Orthogonal is another way of saying ”at right angles” or ”perpendicular.” We tend to use it in mathematics since it is not intrinsically tied to any specific number of dimensions. 35",Book 3_2036060.pdf,36,"Here are the notes on the topic in advanced bullet-point markdown format:

### Properties of Eigenvectors
#### **Orthogonality**
* Eigenvectors of a matrix are **orthogonal** to each other, meaning they are at right angles or perpendicular.
* This property is essential for dimensionality reduction.

### Consequences of Orthogonality

"Previously, we stated that for PCA we would create a graph for each pair of features. We also said that we could work out the centroid for that plot and determine the variance as the average Euclidian distance, which turns out to be what we might otherwise call the “Mean Squared Error.” The next step is to find the unit1eigenvectors2and corresponding eigenvalues for the covariance matrix. With this step completed, we simply identify the eigenvector with the greatest eigenvalue. The eigenvector corresponding to this greatest eigenvalue is the principal component , indicating that this specific pairing of features best characterizes or captures the variation in our data. 1Scaled to the unit value, or 1. 2Recall that these can be thought of axes that are orthogonal to the normal axes onto which our data might typically be projected. 36",Book 3_2036060.pdf,37,"Here are the notes on Principal Component Analysis (PCA) in advanced markdown format:

"Feature Scaling Feature scaling is a technique used to standardize the range and distribution of independent variables or features in a dataset. There are several approaches to feature scaling, including: •Min-Max Scaling : This method scales the data by transforming the feature values such that the minimum value becomes 0 and the maximum value becomes 1. •Standardization : This method scales the data by subtracting the mean from each value and dividing by the standard deviation. This results in a distribution with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. •Normalization : This method scales the data by transforming the values so that the feature values lie between 0 and 1, with the minimum value becoming 0 and the maximum value becoming 1. •Robust Scaling : This method is similar to min-max scaling, but it uses the median and the interquartile range (IQR) instead of the minimum and maximum values. This makes it more resistant to outliers. It is important to note that feature scaling is often applied as a preprocessing step before training a machine learning model, as it can help the model converge faster and perform better. In many cases, we can get away with not bothering to scale our data. If you consider the data on the slide, however, you will see a case that illustrates why scaling can be so important. This also illustrates the problem that you experienced (or will experience) when completing the previous exercise. Think about what it is that our clustering algorithm tries to do.

"distances and finding similarities based on positions in space. Can you imagine where in space a data point at (590.23, 1025, 443, 6, 19283821823) would be? Granted, this is in ℝ5space. Still, that final coordinate will move the point very far away from the origin.

"Determining Numbers of Clusters We have successfully used K-Means, but we are left with a pretty important problem. How can we know how many clusters we should be producing? We have no doubt realized that dimensionality reduction is very important, especially when it comes to trying to visualize our clusters and eliminate unnecessary data and noise, but it doesn’t help us to know how many clusters we should have. Of course, we could plot the data and look at it, determining visually how many clusters are present, but this isn’t a very robust method. We want something a bit more rigorous. The mathematical tools that we most commonly use to determine how many clusters are present center around the idea of variance. Consider two extremes. If we have one cluster, how much variance will we have in the cluster? The maximum amount. On the other hand, what if we have 𝑛samples and we calculate K-Means as 𝑘 = 𝑛 ?

"We can think of the variance as the Euclidian distance from the centroid. We defined the Euclidian distance previously using the Pythagorean formula. We have also thought previously about the problem of considering a purely Euclidian distance at any ℝ𝑛where 𝑛 > 2 and that the higher the value of 𝑛, the less likely that the Euclidian distance is meaningful. Fortunately, there are other ways to measure variance and other ways to visualize that variance. 42",Book 3_2036060.pdf,43,"Here are the advanced bullet-point notes summarizing the important parts of the passage:

"The Elbow Method Figure 3: Elbow Method DiagramThe most commonly used technique for identi- fying the ideal number of clusters in our data is known as the Elbow Method. The Elbow Method requires that we calculate K-Means re- peatedly for all numbers of clusters between 1 and 𝑛. For each of these, we calculate the sum of the variance within all of the clusters. We then graph the number of clusters against the to- tal variance. You will frequently see this value abbreviated as WCSS, which stands for Within- Cluster Sum of Squares . When we visualize this data as a 2d plot, we will usually find that the slope of the plot starts out very steep and becomes shallower and shal- lower until it reaches a slope of 0. It makes sense that the slope begins, effectively, at infin- ity since the variance is maximized with one cluster. It also makes sense that when the number of clusters equals the number of data samples, the slope will be ero since the variance is ero. It’s what happens in between that’s interesting. Notice that in the graph in figure 3, there is a sharp change in the slope at two clusters. This implies that there is at least one, possibly two, or (less likely) three “real” clusters in this data. 43",Book 3_2036060.pdf,44,"**The Elbow Method**

"A somewhat related, but different, algorithm that is used for data categorization or classification is K-Nearest Neighbors. While this isn’t the same as K-Means Clustering, there are similarities. K-Nearest Neighbors, or KNN, approaches classification from the point of view that an unknown data point is most likely to be the same as other data points that are nearby. When the data separates into clear clusters, this seems to be an obvious corollary to K-Means. What happens when the data doesn’t separate so clearly? The KNN algorithm attempts to offer a solution to this problem by allowing you to define a number of neighbors, 𝑛, to which the unknown data is compared. It works as follows: •Using pre-categorized, known data, decide upon some distance function. •Using this distance function, calculate the distance from the unknown sample to every known sample. •Using the selected value of 𝑛, determine which 𝑛neighbors are closest. •Evaluate the 𝑛neighbors to determine which category is in the majority. •Assume that the unknown data is of the same class as the majority of its 𝑛neighbors. While this sounds great, there are some issues with it. First, it should be immediately obvious to you that it will be expensive to classify every new data point because we must calculate the distances to every known data point. This implies, then, that the more data we have, the more expensive this becomes. A second issue has to do with how we select the value for 𝑛. What happens if we select an even value for 𝑛? Alternatively, what if the value of 𝑛is evenly divisible by the number of classes that are closest? Could we end up with no clear majority? What do we do now? We could try to address this last weakness by trying to break the tie by increasing the value of 𝑛 dynamically. Even so, and while KNN is both easy to use and widely used in basic applications, 45",Book 3_2036060.pdf,46,"Here are the notes on K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm in advanced markdown format:

"DBSCAN We saw that one of the major downsides of using K-Means was that it makes use of Euclidian distance by default. Certainly, there are other distance functions that can be used, but perhaps there’s a better way to cluster our data in general. That brings us to DBSCAN. It seems important to point out that while “DB” is in the name of this method, it has absolutely nothing to do with databases1. DBSCAN is the acronym for Distance-Based Spectral Clustering of Applications with Noise. You’ll notice that the word distance is right within the name of this technique. While distance is still being used, it is being used in an entirely different way that results in much more effective clustering in many applications. 1At least not beyond the fact that your data might be in a database. 47",Book 3_2036060.pdf,48,"**DBSCAN Notes**

### Introduction
* DBSCAN (Distance-Based Spectral Clustering of Applications with Noise) is a clustering method that improves upon K-Means' limitations
* **Key concept:** distance-based clustering, but with a different approach than K-Means

### Advantages
* More effective clustering in many applications
* Can handle **noise** (outliers) in the data

### Distance Measurement
* DBSCAN uses distance measurement in a different way than K-Means
* **Distance** is a key aspect of DBSCAN, as indicated by its name

### Misconception
* DBSCAN has **no relation to databases**, despite having ""DB"" in its name
* The name is simply an acronym for the full name of the technique: Distance-Based Spectral Clustering of Applications with Noise"
"The scan requires that we find two values. The first value, 𝜀1, represents the maximum radius from the center of a point within a cluster. This is where the concept of distance comes in. The second value defines the minimum number of points that must be within 𝜀of the potential center of a cluster for a cluster to form. The DBSCAN clustering process, then, follows the following algorithm. 1.Select values for 𝜀and the minimum number of points for cluster formation. 2.Select the next point in the dataset; if this is the first pass, select some random first point. 3.Determine if there are at least the minimum required number of points within radius 𝜀of that point. 1.If there are, create a cluster and add those (central) points. 2.For each of those points, find all points that in the set that are within 𝜀of these points. 3.Add these points and repeat these last two steps until there are no additional points to add; the most distanced points within the cluster become border points . 4.Go back to step two and repeat all steps until all points have either been included in a cluster or excluded from all clusters. 1𝜀is the Greek letter Epsilon. 48",Book 3_2036060.pdf,49,"**DBSCAN Clustering Algorithm Notes**
===============================

### Key Concepts

* **𝜀 (Epsilon)**: maximum radius from the center of a point within a cluster
* **Minimum number of points**: minimum points required for cluster formation

### DBSCAN Algorithm Steps
#### Step 1: Select Values

* Choose values for 𝜀 and minimum number of points for cluster formation

#### Step 2: Select Next Point

* Select the next point in the dataset
* If first pass, select a random first point

#### Step 3: Determine Cluster Formation

* Check if at least the minimum required number of points are within radius 𝜀 of the selected point
	+ If yes, create a cluster and add central points
	+ For each central point, find all points within 𝜀 and add them to the cluster
	+ Repeat until no additional points to add; most distanced points become border points
#### Step 4: Repeat Process

* Go back to Step 2 and repeat until all points have either been included in a cluster or excluded from all clusters"
"This technique has some really useful advantages. First, it is trivial to find the radial distance in any way that is meaningful for us. In other words, we do not have the same problem that we have been working with the Euclidean distance. We can define a custom distance function quite easily. Another fantastic advantage is that our clusters can take any shape at all. Rather than the clusters being defined by using some kind of linear, planar, or hyperplanar boundary, the data clusters nat- urally based on its spatial location. This means that our clusters can end up taking on any shape in any number of dimensions. We also benefit from the fact that the clustering process automatically identifies outliers or anoma- lies. If there are points that fail to be included in a cluster or who do not have enough neighbors within a radius of 𝜀then these are by definition anomalies. By naturally excluding them, the algo- rithm is naturally robust. In fact, not only do the outliers have minimal influence… they have no influence! Perhaps the most attractive aspect of DBSCAN, however, is the fact that we do not need to define the number of clusters that are present! The algorithm determines the number of clusters automatically, making our lives much easier. This doesn’t mean that everything’s roses. For example, we may now know that there are 𝑥clusters in our data, but be no closer to understanding what those clusters mean. Additionally, the method is not deterministic. If it were deterministic, we could run this algorithm multiple times against the same data to be sure that we would always arrive at the same clusters. Instead, if we run this multiple times, we can end up with border points being digested into clusters that are processed later. In other words, when we have close clusters with shared borders, we can find that border points will switch between two neighboring clusters, simply depending upon which cluster is generated last. Finally, a minor issue is that we must still determine good values for the minimum number of points 49",Book 3_2036060.pdf,50,"Here are the notes on DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) in advanced bullet-point markdown format:

"We can offer you some guidance. As a rule of thumb, the minimum number of points should prob- ably be something larger than the overall dimensionality of the data.

"Supervised Learning At this point, we’re going to change gears and begin talking about supervised learning. As men- tioned previously, supervised learning means that we are attempting to categorize the data rather than clustering. This requires that there are pre-defined labels that we can use as ground truth. Our goal is to take the existing data and use it to train some model that can then be used to predict how new data should be properly classified. The first such type of classification that we will work with is called support vector classifiers. In fact, the remainder of the methods that will be used in this volume of our course will all be statistical methods, none of which make use of neural networks. Neural networks and that type of supervised learning will be what we cover exclusively in the final two volumes of our course. 53",Book 3_2036060.pdf,54,"Here are the notes on Supervised Learning in advanced markdown format:

**Supervised Learning**
======================

### Definition
* **Supervised Learning**: Attempting to categorize data using pre-defined labels as ground truth.

### Goal
* Train a model using existing data to predict how new data should be classified.

### Classification Methods
* **Support Vector Classifiers**: A type of classification method used in supervised learning.
* **Statistical Methods**: All methods used in this volume of the course, excluding neural networks.

### Course Outline
* **Neural Networks and Supervised Learning**: To be covered exclusively in the final two volumes of the course."
"Classification As useful as clustering methods are when it comes to exploring and understanding our data, they are not particularly good at helping us to classify our data. There are mechanisms that are quite similar to our clustering techniques that can lead to classification, but classification systems all rely on having known labels for the training data. It is easy to mistake the ability to generate a cluster and assign some data point to a cluster with the idea of classification. Remember that when we generate clusters, we really don’t know exactly what those clusters mean. We must examine the output carefully and make sure that we understand the different components that make up the features for the clusters in order to determine what kind of title we might associate with a cluster. This is why unsupervised clustering methods are more interesting when it comes to separating different groups of things, like customers, to understand how those things are similar. These can be very useful when it comes to identifying the kinds of products that you should put in front of a customer who falls into a particular cluster. We can assume that if this customer is similar to the other customers in his or her cluster, and they have all purchased something that this customer has not, then this product is likely something that they are interested in. We have no idea why they are interested in it. That would require additional analysis to determine what it is about that product that is appealing to that cluster. When classifying data, on the other hand, we have very clearly in mind the different categories that the data may fall into. For example, we have the notion of normal communication versus abnormal or malicious communication. The idea of Ham versus Spam. The notion of compromised or not compromised. While clustering can help us to identify features that might lead to the identification of some of these classes, supervised methods are far more appropriate for predicting how a new piece of data should be labeled. 54",Book 3_2036060.pdf,55,"**Classification vs Clustering**
======================================================

### Key Concepts
* **Classification**: assigning labels to data based on known categories
* **Clustering**: grouping similar data points without known labels
* **Supervised learning**: methods relying on labeled training data for classification
* **Unsupervised learning**: methods discovering patterns in unlabeled data (clustering)

### Key Differences
* Classification:
	+ Requires labeled training data
	+ Assigns labels to new data based on known categories
	+ Predicts how new data should be labeled
* Clustering:
	+ Does not require labeled training data
	+ Generates clusters without known labels
	+ Requires analysis to determine cluster meaning

### Applications
* Clustering:
	+ Separating groups (e.g., customers) to understand similarities
	+ Identifying products of interest to a particular group
* Classification:
	+ Normal vs abnormal/malicious communication (e.g., Ham vs Spam)
	+ Compromised vs not compromised systems

### Important Notes
* Clustering is not classification, despite similarities in techniques
* Clustering can identify features leading to classification, but supervised methods are more suitable for predicting labels"
"Since we find supervised methods so useful practically within our own organization and security practice, we will begin to transition to these models now. This is not to imply that there are no other ways the data can be clustered and that there are no other clustering algorithms. There certainly are. However, at least in our experience, we find out within the field of information security these are most useful for doing initial data exploration or perhaps analyzing some new type of behavior or event before transitioning to a supervised categorization or classification model. In this volume, we will consider Support Vector Machines, which lead to other simple statistical classifiers such as Decision Trees and Random Forests. We will also speak briefly about KNN1, but we will not do any labs associated with this type of supervised learning. The remaining volumes and labs in this course in the following days will focus exclusively on the application of deep learning neural networks of a variety of types. We will also spend some time at the very end of class covering genetic search algorithms and their application in machine learning. 1K-Nearest Neighbors 55",Book 3_2036060.pdf,56,"**Supervised Learning in Information Security**

"There are a variety of kinds of statistical learning. It is certainly true that statistics plays a big role in almost all machine learning, but not all; however, there are some methods that are exclusively statistical. Three of these are KNN, Support Vector Classifiers, and Decision Trees. Much as the unsupervised method K-Means can be viewed as the parallel or a precursor to the KNN approach, Support Vector Classifiers and Decision Trees can be viewed as the precursors or building blocks upon which more complex methods are built. As you will shortly see, for instance, a Support Vector Machine is simply an automatic method of determining an appropriate Support Vector Classifier. Similarly, a Random Forest can be viewed as a simple collection of decision trees. 56",Book 3_2036060.pdf,57,"Here are the notes on statistical learning in advanced markdown format:

"Support Vector Classifiers Consider the data set in the slide. Here, we have grafted student numbers against student grades. We have arbitrarily set a passing point of 65 for a particular exam. If we set this point at 65, then we can see that a decision boundary exists at this point. A decision boundary is some value or mechanism that can be used to easily classify data. In this case, it’s quite simple. If a student scores 65 or above, they pass. If they score 64.9, then they fail. This would be described as a hard boundary. What if there is some flexibility? Could it be that there are students who, because of special cir- cumstances perhaps, would be considered to have a passing grade even if they scored below 65? Are there some students for whom the 65 would not be a sufficient grade for them to pass? In other words, could it be that our hard boundary results in some students being misclassified? In a case such as this, we might choose to apply a softboundary. In a soft boundary, there would be some margin within which certain values, students in our case, might be misclassified, and that would be OK. 57",Book 3_2036060.pdf,58,"Here are the notes on Support Vector Classifiers in advanced bullet-point format:

**Support Vector Classifiers**
=============================

* **Decision Boundary**: a value or mechanism used to classify data
* **Hard Boundary**: a strict classification rule, e.g., students scoring 65 or above pass, below 65 fail
* **Soft Boundary**: a boundary that allows for some flexibility and margin of error in classification
* **Margin of Error**: a range of values where misclassification is acceptable
* **Applications**:
	+ Student grades: a soft boundary might allow students with special circumstances to pass with a grade below 65
	+ Other scenarios where rigid classification rules are not suitable

**Key Concepts**:
* **Classification**: the process of assigning a label or category to data
* **Support Vector**: a data point that lies closest to the decision boundary
* **Classifier**: a machine learning model that predicts a class label for new, unseen data"
"Another way to view this decision boundary is as something that is tied more directly to the data itself. For example, if we choose to “grade on a curve” then we’re going to use the body of student scores all together to determine what the passing point should be. If we were to do this, we would be applying some statistical method to determine how many should pass and fail. This method of discerning this decision boundary, however, is definitely subject to outliers. A very strong outlier will dramatically impact the overall passing point. This method of determining the decision boundary, however, is definitely subject to outliers. Very large or very small outliers will strongly influence the overall passing point. Let’s see if we can translate this into a more realistic classification problem. 58",Book 3_2036060.pdf,59,"Here are the notes in advanced bullet-point format:

**Decision Boundary**
===============

### Tied to Data

* Decision boundary can be viewed as tied directly to the data itself
* Example: ""grading on a curve"" where the body of student scores determines the passing point

### Statistical Method
---------------

* Involves applying a statistical method to determine the number of passes and failures
* However, this method is **subject to outliers**

### Outliers' Impact
---------------

* **Very strong outliers** can dramatically impact the overall passing point
* **Large or small outliers** will strongly influence the passing point

### Realistic Classification Problem
-----------------------------

* This concept can be translated into a more realistic classification problem"
"Imagine that we gather data regarding user logon failures. Perhaps we come up with a decision boundary, a hard boundary, of four logon failures. If a user fails to log on more than four times in a single day, we are going to classify that user as “evil.” Users who are able to successfully log on without failing at least four times will be considered “good.” When we consider this type of classification in terms of grades, having a hard decision boundary likely seems completely fair and useful. The idea of grading on a curve, unless the professor gives very difficult exams, doesn’t seem very fair because it implies that a certain percentage of students must fail every exam. When we translate this to be a problem involving user logon failures, however, that hard boundary seems inflexible. If we were responsible for investigating every “evil” user, the more users we have, the more users will fall into this category. Nothing about our boundary takes into consideration how our users behave from day to day. The boundary is exactly as we’ve previously described it. Hard and arbitrary. 59",Book 3_2036060.pdf,60,"Here are the advanced bullet-point notes summarizing the important parts of the passage:

**Classifying Users based on Logon Failures**
================================================

* **Decision Boundary**: 4 logon failures in a single day is the threshold to classify a user as ""**evil**""
* **Classification Rules**:
	+ Users who fail to log on more than 4 times in a day are considered ""**evil**""
	+ Users who successfully log on without failing at least 4 times are considered ""**good**""
* **Limitations of Hard Decision Boundary**:
	+ Doesn't consider user behavior over time
	+ Becomes inflexible with a large number of users
	+ More users will fall into the ""**evil**"" category as the user base grows
* **Comparison to Grading on a Curve**:
	+ Hard decision boundary seems fair and useful in a grading context
	+ However, in the context of user logon failures, the hard boundary seems arbitrary and inflexible"
"If we continue with this analogy, we can see that we will definitely end up with misclassifications. For example, we have now specified that there is a user named Bill, a person who is a real user, who has failed to log on correctly six times. Simultaneously, there is an attacker named evil Eddie who has successfully logged on, but he has only failed to authenticate two times. In other words, we have misclassified a “good” user as evil and an “evil” user as good. 60",Book 3_2036060.pdf,61,"Here are the notes in advanced bullet-point markdown format:

**Misclassification in Authentication**
=====================================

* **Example of Misclassification**
	+ User **Bill** (real user) fails to log on correctly 6 times
	+ Attacker **Eddie** (evil user) successfully logs on, but fails to authenticate only 2 times
* **Consequence of Misclassification**
	+ **False Negative**: Bill (good user) is misclassified as an attacker
	+ **False Positive**: Eddie (attacker) is misclassified as a good user"
"We can use a soft boundary with a margin to improve the situation. A soft boundary simply means that we are willing to accept some degree of misclassification to result in a better overall classifi- cation result. This means that rather than strictly classifying everything above or below the line, we are willing to have some outliers or anomalies that end up being misclassified in order to more generally be accurate. Simultaneously, what we’d really love to do, is try to work out some way to draw our boundary to maximize the number of points that are classified properly. For example, might it be possible to draw a line in some higher dimensional space that would properly classify Eddie as evil and Bill as good? When we say higher dimensional space, you might be thinking that we need to gather more infor- mation to have more features for a classification. Certainly, this would be a good approach, but what if there are no more features together? What if this data is all we have? Might it be possible to take the data as it is and generate additional features or translated into rehire dimensional space even without having additional data upon which to base the analysis? The answer turns out to be yes! Ultimately, the goal of this system is to try to work out a maximal margin classifier or boundary. This means that it is the optimal margin that ideally separates the categories. Sometimes this is very easy to do, sometimes it requires more effort. Let’s look at an example where this is very difficult, or even impossible, and then see how Support Vector Machines can be used to solve the same problem. 61",Book 3_2036060.pdf,62,"Here are the notes on the topic of classification boundaries and Support Vector Machines:

**Classification Boundaries and Support Vector Machines**

**Soft Boundaries**
-----------------

* A soft boundary means accepting some degree of misclassification for a better overall classification result

"Support Vector Machines So far, Support Vector Classifiers seem somewhat limited. If a problem has an easy-to-define or discernable boundary condition, they are simple enough to use, but what about more complex data? Even when that data may have some discernable boundary in higher dimensions, how are we to find it? Also, how, exactly, would we shift the data into a higher number of dimensions? Before exploring a solution to this, we should explain that Support Vector Classifiers are an example of the more general Support Vector Machine. Support Vector Machines generally come in two flavors: Classifiers and Regressors. In our course we will only use them as classifiers, but the training and use of a SVR works in the same way. The only difference is that it outputs a continuous value rather than a classification. To create a useful classifier that operates in higher dimensions, we need to create a Support Vector Classifier with what we might describe as some augmentation of the data. Augmentation is a good word to use because the original data is unchanged, unlike a Principal Component Analysis wherein we are creating a component that characterizes two underlying components. Instead, the original data is still used, but additional dimensions are created by combining the original data through the use of a kernel function1. 1You will encounter this term in other areas of machine learning. In all cases, a kernel function is simply a function that is used to transform data in some way. This term can be confusing for computer science people initially, since we often use the word ”kernel” in a very different way. 63",Book 3_2036060.pdf,64,"Here are the notes on Support Vector Machines in advanced bullet-point markdown format:

**Support Vector Machines**

* **Support Vector Classifiers**: Limited to problems with easy-to-define or discernable boundary conditions
* **Shortcomings**:
	+ Unable to handle complex data with non-discernable boundaries
	+ Difficulty in finding boundaries in higher dimensions
	+ Unclear how to shift data into higher dimensions

"Kernel Functions Figure 4: Failed Logons, originalA kernel function is some function 𝑘(𝑖, 𝑗) that maps the data from its current set of dimensions into some arbitrarily higher number of dimen- sions. Thinking about this more simply, it is adding a dimension, or axis, along which our data can be plotted (if we are thinking visually). Let’s illustrate this. Before we get into a kernel function, we’d like to point out that there is actually something in- correct about how we represented our notion of successful logons and student grades. Consider the graph in figure 4. In this graph, we show the number of failed lo- gons along the Y axis and an arbitrary person number along the X axis. Is this person num- ber, however, really a feature? No! The arbitrary ordinal number representing the individual is completely useless data and isn’t really a part of our dataset. We should not have graphed it and, by doing so, we made our Support Vector Classifier more complex than it needed to be. Really, our graph should have looked more like figure 5. This figure shows the one-dimensional representation of the data with a larger point representing our decision boundary of four failed logons. Notice how this dramatically simplifies the problem. This representation makes much more sense. The only significant data present in the original data is 64",Book 3_2036060.pdf,65,"Here are the notes on kernel functions and the given passage:

**Kernel Functions**
======================

* A kernel function, `𝑘(𝑖, 𝑗)`, maps data from its current dimensions to a higher number of dimensions.
* It adds a dimension or axis, allowing data to be plotted in a higher-dimensional space.

**Incorrect Representation**
---------------------------

* In the original graph (Figure 4), the person number was incorrectly used as a feature.
* The arbitrary ordinal number representing the individual is **useless data** and not part of the dataset.

**Correct Representation**

* The corrected graph (Figure 5) shows a one-dimensional representation of the data.
* The decision boundary is represented by a larger point, indicating four failed logons.
* This representation **simplifies the problem** and makes more sense.

* Kernel functions increase the dimensionality of data.
* Incorrect features can unnecessarily complicate the problem.
* Correct representation of data is crucial for accurate analysis."
"the number of failed logon attempts. We can now plainly see these without the irrelevant dimension of which user failed or succeeded to log into the system. Figure 5: Failed Logons as a 1 dimensional num- ber lineThis brings us back to the idea of creating higher dimensionality. Clearly, there is no value in adding arbitrary dimensions with no meaning. What’s the alternative? This is where kernel functions come in. We stated that kernel func- tions map the input to some output in a higher dimension. Let’s begin with the simplest stan- dard kernel function: the Polynomial Kernel. Polynomial Kernel This kernel function applies some polynomial function to the input data, generating an additional co- ordinate in some higher dimension. We have chosen our example problem (and specifically pointed out that we really have one-dimensional data) to allow us to easily translate our ℝ1data into ℝ2space. For this case, let us define the kernel as follows: 𝑘(𝑥𝑖) = (𝑥𝑖)2 Figure 6: 2nd Order Polynomial KernelWow, that was simple! What impact does this have? How does it change the visualization? Consider figure 6. In this case, this kernel function doesn’t help us very much, but you can see that it dramatically changes the structure of the data. If we were considering data where one category clustered toward the center and the other was in the tails, this type of kernel would be a simple and perfect way to define the boundary condition. You will notice that the function that we have de- fined is slightly different from the kernel func- tion in the slide. The example in the slide is the general form of a polynomial kernel function. In that generalization, 𝑑represents the degree of the polynomial that we are creating. A slightly more generalized form would change 𝑥𝑖𝑥𝑗+ 1to read 𝑥𝑖𝑥𝑗+ 𝑐where 𝑐is some constant value. In our specific case, we have preserved 𝑐; we have set 𝑐 = 0 , so it disappears. Gaussian Kernel There are other well-known kernel functions that might be applied. Consider the Gaussian Kernel function: 65",Book 3_2036060.pdf,66,"**Kernel Functions in Higher Dimensionality**

* **General Form**: `k(xi, xj) = (xi * xj + 1)^d`, where `d` is the degree of the polynomial
* **Simplified Form**: `k(xi) = (xi)^2` (used in the example)

### Alternative Kernel Functions
-----------------------------

* **Gaussian Kernel**: another well-known kernel function that can be applied"
"𝑘(𝑥, 𝑦) = 𝑒−‖𝑥−𝑦‖2 2𝜎 2 At this point in the course, you should recognize much of what’s happening on the right-hand side of that equation. The only new symbol for us is the 𝑒, which represents exponentiation involving 𝑒, Euler’s number1. If you look closely at what sits in the fraction to which Euler’s number is being raised, you will see some familiar terms. ‖𝑥 − 𝑦‖ represents the Euclidian distance formula, which is being squared to prevent uncomfortable square roots. This is a trick we have seen before. 2𝜎2uses the term 𝜎, which you might recognize from statistics. This represents the standard de- viation. When we write it as 𝜎2, we are referring to the variance, bypassing the final step in the standard deviation of taking another of those nasty square roots that are so unpleasant. The entire denominator is double the variance. The entire purpose of this kernel is to apply a mapping function that translates our data into a Gaussian normal distribution, smoothing the data. This is very useful when our data contains a great deal of noise. Radial Basis Function Kernel The Radial Basis Function is related to the Gaussian kernel. It is expressed as: 𝑘(𝑥𝑖, 𝑥𝑗) = 𝑒−𝛾‖𝑥𝑖−𝑥𝑗‖2 You may see some alternative notations of this function. For example, rather than using 𝑘(𝑥𝑖, 𝑥𝑗) you may see 𝑘(𝑥, 𝑥′). There is really no difference. This is simply implying that we are taking two different values for 𝑥from the data. The 𝛾is new, however. The symbol 𝛾represents some function. Remember that mathematicians love to generalize things. Since this function can change, it has been generalized out. In programming terms, it has been “refactored” out. Let’s look at one specific example of a Radial Basis Function: If𝛾 =1 2𝜎2then 𝑘(𝑥, 𝑥′) = 𝑒−‖𝑥−𝑥′‖2 2𝜎 2 Does that formula look familiar? That’s the Gaussian kernel function! How did that happen? It comes down to generalization. The Gaussian kernel is a specific example of the more general Radial Basis Function. Unlike the Gaussian kernel, however, we can replace 𝛾with any function of any order that we need. It is for this reason that it is frequently stated that the Radial Basis Function can be used to create decision boundaries in infinite dimensions. 1Euler’s number, typically notated as 𝑒, is approximately 2.71828. You will discover that this number, similar to 𝜋, appears repeatedly throughout mathematics, sometimes for no apparent reason. The reason that it is used in this Gaussian function is that it has a very special property: The exponentiation 𝑓 (𝑥) = 𝑒𝑥is its own derivative. This can lead to some very handy simplifications when performing algebraic manipulations and makes it a very popular number to use as a base in mathematics. This is connected to why the natural logarithm, 𝑙𝑛() , is also wildly popular. 66",Book 3_2036060.pdf,67,"Here are the notes in advanced bullet-point markdown format:

"Let’s start with a simple illustration. Let’s imagine that we have a basket of fruit. What we’d really like to do is teach our computer how to distinguish one fruit from another. As you know, our computers have become smarter and smarter over the years. You and I can see that there’s not a very big gap between giving Siri my shopping list and having my Tesla go to the store and just buy the food for me. Still, we need to make sure that the computer is picking up the right groceries. In our basket, we have apples (more than one kind), pears, grapes, raspberries, blueberries, plums, cherries, and more. Our plan is to take out one fruit at a time, in no particular order, and try to explain important characteristics of each fruit to the computer. Visually, this isn’t a difficult task. I doubt you have ever confused a grape with a Granny Smith apple even though they are both round, green, have a skin and a stem, and may have seeds. As you know, however, our computers aren’t currently great at seeing things. We need to describe our fruit in some other way. Is there some set of attributes that we can define where the aggregate of those attributes well distin- guishes each fruit? 70",Book 3_2036060.pdf,71,"Here are the notes on the topic of teaching a computer to distinguish between different fruits:

### Fruits Recognition
#### Goal
* Teach a computer to distinguish one fruit from another

#### Fruits in the Basket
* **Apples** (more than one kind)
* **Pears**
* **Grapes**
* **Raspberries**
* **Blueberries**
* **Plums**
* **Cherries**
* More...

#### Computer Limitations
* Computers are not great at **visual recognition**
* Need to describe fruits in a way that a computer can understand

#### Attribute-Based Recognition
* Define a set of attributes that distinguish each fruit
* Aggregate of attributes should uniquely identify each fruit"
"Let’s start with the following categories: Color Shape Size Taste This seems OK so far, but we immediately seize upon another problem. Our computer isn’t going to be super good at knowing what “round” means. Really, our computer needs this information to somehow be translated into numbers. After all, it is a computer. Let’s give this another try: Red Green Blue Round Small Medium Large Sweet Tart Sour Much better! Now, if we wanted to tell the computer about a Granny Smith, we might encode it this way: Red Green Blue Round Small Medium Large Sweet Tart Sour 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 While this doesn’t taste nearly as good as the real thing, it’s a pretty good approximation. Intuitively, it also feels as though we have a sufficient number of attributes to represent a wide variety of fruit. Now that we’re ready to train the computer, we think about things a little bit more and realize that it’s going to be a real drag to write a program that implements all of the if...then...else statements to distinguish each fruit. Wouldn’t it be awesome if, instead, we wrote a program that could create its own if...then...else statements automatically? Then it could work out the categorizations for itself. Then it could learn! 71",Book 3_2036060.pdf,72,"Here are the notes on the topic in advanced markdown format:

**Machine Learning for Fruit Categorization**
=============================================

**Challenges in Fruit Representation**
------------------------------------

* Initial attempt at categorization:
	+ Color: none
	+ Shape: round
	+ Size: none
	+ Taste: none
* **Problem**: Computer struggles to understand abstract concepts like ""round""

**Numerical Representation**
-----------------------------

* **Solution**: Represent attributes with numbers
	+ Color: Red (0), Green (1), Blue (0)
	+ Shape: Round (1), Small (0), Medium (0), Large (0)
	+ Size: Small (0), Medium (0), Large (0)

"Figure 7: A Simple Decision TreeThis is precisely what Decision Trees do. If you consider figure 7you can see an example of how the computer breaks down this problem. Imag- ine that we generate the features for a Granny Smith and a green seed- less grape. They are both green, but the grape is small, and the apple is medium. The grape is sweet, while the apple is sweet and tart. When we hand these descriptions, or attributes, to the Decision Tree algorithm, it de- cides that absolutely the best way to distinguish these two fruits, the only two fruits in the universe as far as it knows right now, is to consider field 𝑋[7] . In the data that was fed to the Decision Tree used to make our figure, attribute seven represents the tartness of the fruit. Please notice that the Decision Tree has made its classification based on only one feature. If we were to feed it more training data, it would no doubt begin to use more and more of our features, but it will never use more features than it needs to. If you think back to our clustering discussions and PCA, you could analogize that Decision Trees intuitively determine the most important components, or features, in the training data by using them. 72",Book 3_2036060.pdf,73,"Here are the notes on Decision Trees in advanced bullet-point format:

**Decision Trees**
================

* **Definition**: A machine learning algorithm that breaks down a problem into smaller sub-problems, making it easier to classify data.

**How Decision Trees Work**
-------------------------

* Take in attributes (features) of data points (e.g., fruits)
* **Decide** which attribute is most important to distinguish between data points
* Create a **decision** based on the chosen attribute
* **Recursively** repeat the process until a classification is made

**Example: Figure 7**
-------------------

* **Granny Smith apple** and **green seedless grape** are used as examples
* Attributes:
	+ Color: both green
	+ Size: grape (small), apple (medium)
	+ Taste: grape (sweet), apple (sweet and tart)
* Decision Tree **chooses** attribute **𝑋[7]** (tartness) to distinguish between the fruits
* **Classification** is made based on this single feature

**Key Concepts**
----------------

* **Feature selection**: Decision Trees select the most important features to classify data
* **Sparsity**: Decision Trees only use as many features as necessary to make a classification
* **Analogy to Clustering and PCA**: Decision Trees determine the most important components (features) in the training data, similar to clustering and PCA"
"You may notice that the nodes in our tree in figure 7all have a term labeled “Gini.” The Gini coefficient isn’t something that we’re going to derive or even give you the formula for. The only time that we will encounter it in our course is when using Decision Trees or Random Forests. This term comes from the field of Economics. Basically, it represents the differences between areas under a line of equality and a Lorenz Curve (another thing we will not derive or explain further). The “line of equality,” however, is worth a moment or two. TheLine of Equality represents a line that divides our data perfectly in half. Of course, that is the ideal, and it might not be possible to do this in every single case, but this lies at the heart of what the Decision Tree algorithm attempts to do. You can actually see it in 7. Notice that the root node of that simple tree has a Gini value of 0.5. In other words, 50% of the data lies to the right and 50% lies to the left. If you look at the bottom nodes, both have a Gini value of 0. The simple reason is that everything that reaches this node goes into this “box.” There is no further differentiation that occurs. So, then, as we fit our data to our Decision Tree, otherwise known as “training,” the algorithm seeks to add nodes that divide the data in half, creating clear differentiations. If you think about this in terms of a Support Vector Classifier, it is attempting to define a hard boundary at every branching where 50% of the data lies in one direction and 50% in the other. In fact, this analogy can be taken further. To be clear, Decision Trees are notusing Support Vector Classifiers, but we can certainly imagine that each node in the tree is defining something very much like a Support Vector Classifier to differentiate the data. A simple way to understand what the Gini coefficient is about is to think of it as a measure of information gain. In the field of information theory, information transfer doesn’t work in a way that is intuitive to people who work with networks and data transfers. Imagine, for example, that 73",Book 3_2036060.pdf,74,"Here are the notes on the topic of Decision Trees and the Gini Coefficient:

**Decision Trees and the Gini Coefficient**
=====================================================

**What is the Gini Coefficient?**
--------------------------------

* A term used in Economics, not derived or explained in this course
* Represents the differences between areas under a line of equality and a Lorenz Curve

**Line of Equality**
--------------------

* A line that divides the data perfectly in half
* Ideal representation of a Decision Tree algorithm

**Decision Tree Algorithm**
-----------------------------

* Aims to add nodes that divide the data in half, creating clear differentiations
* Seeks to define a hard boundary at every branching where 50% of the data lies in one direction and 50% in the other

**Gini Coefficient in Decision Trees**
--------------------------------------

* Used to measure the impurity of a node (i.e., how well the data is separated)
* A measure of information gain
* High Gini value indicates a node with mixed data, while a low Gini value indicates a node with separated data

**Analogy to Support Vector Classifier**
----------------------------------------

* Each node in the Decision Tree can be thought of as defining a hard boundary similar to a Support Vector Classifier
* However, Decision Trees do not use Support Vector Classifiers"
"packets are passing between two hosts. We might intuitively think that this means that information is passing back and forth, but from the perspective of information theory it is not. Why not? In information theory, you can only gain information when you learn something that you didn’t know before. In other words, if I send you a packet and that packet contains anything that you already knew, none of that data can be counted as an information gain. If I send you a terabyte of data but only 8 bytes of that are new information for you, your net information gain is 8 bytes. Similarly, the algorithm used to build the decision tree is attempting to maximize the information gain at every decision node. This can lead to decision nodes that might not be what a human would intuitively select, but those nodes will represent the greatest information gain at every branch. 74",Book 3_2036060.pdf,75,"Here are the notes on the topic of information theory and decision trees in advanced bullet-point format:

**Information Theory**
===============

* **Information Gain**: only occurs when new information is learned that was previously unknown
* **Definition**: Information gain is the amount of new information learned, not the total amount of data transmitted
* **Example**: Sending 1 TB of data, but only 8 bytes of new information, yields an information gain of 8 bytes

**Decision Trees**
===============

* **Goal**: Maximize information gain at every decision node
* **Node Selection**: Algorithm selects nodes that maximize information gain, not necessarily intuitive human choices
* **Result**: Decision nodes may not be what a human would choose, but represent the greatest information gain at every branch"
"With this understanding, let’s continue to add more fruit. When we do so, the algorithm continues to add nodes that attempt, as best it can, to split the data 50/50 at every level. In the end, when we finish training our simple tree, we end up with a tree with a depth of eight. In other words, the most distant node from the root of our tree is eight levels away. Once our Decision Tree is built, we can view it as a Decision Tree Classifier. How is this different? So far, we have only trained our tree. Now that the training is complete, we can pass in some new unknown fruit and ask our tree to tell us what it is! An interesting benefit of a Decision Tree is that classification will always take some finite number of steps, and for a reasonably balanced tree, the number of comparisons will be less than or equal to the number of features. How is this good? Well, there is no computationally intensive mathematics involved. You’ll notice that this is the first section of this volume that doesn’t involve difficult- looking formulas. There is a downside, however. The tree will classify anything you give to it. In other words, while our tree is designed to handle fruit, we could pass a Ford Bronco in, if we were to define the features for it, and it will classify it for us. Chances are, the Ford Bronco would be classified as a large pink grapefruit, which it clearly isn’t! This example might be extreme, but it’s good to have in mind. For example, our network was not trained on kiwis. What might the tree claim that a kiwi is? What all of this means is that the tree can only ever identify something that it has seen before. A Decision Tree is unable to tell you if it cannot classify something. Of course, this limitation applies to pretty much any machine learning technique that performs classification. Just like a child who has never seen a plane in their life might point at the sky and say, “big bird!”, our machine intelligences are very rudimentary and limited by their experience. 75",Book 3_2036060.pdf,76,"Here are the notes in advanced bullet-point markdown format:

"Decision Trees, as simple as they are, do have some significant advantages over Support Vector Machines. Imagine that we use the training data to come up with some high order Radial Basis Function that does a superb job of classifying all of the training data with 100% accuracy. How likely is it that our training data does not cover the full range of possibilities? The answer should be, “Very likely.” After all, if you are solving a problem that is trivially finite, why are you bothering with Radial Basis Functions? Given this problem, we might discover that our SVM does not perform nearly as well when given real-world data. This means that not only are we using a system that can be very computationally expensive1, it’s not even giving us the right answers. While Decision Trees can certainly misclassify things, they do not have the same drawbacks. 1It is worth noting that the greater the number of features and the higher the order of the RBF, the computational requirements grow exponentially. 76",Book 3_2036060.pdf,77,"Here are the notes on Decision Trees vs Support Vector Machines in advanced markdown format:

"Random Forests Decision Trees are definitely easy to create, but we can see that they have some downsides.

"Any machine learning solution will only be as good as the training data that you provide it. Decision Trees are no different. While Decision Trees can often be trained with very little data, more data is always better. Or should we say that more high-quality data is always better. One of the drawbacks of Decision Trees is that they are very susceptible to outliers in the data. When it gets right down to it, a Decision Tree is building what amounts to a series of if...then statements using some value as a hard decision boundary. What happens when things from two categories share many common attributes? Some might even look at what Decision Trees accomplish and think, “I’m better off just doing it myself because the Decision Tree cannot perceive or capture some of the higher order features and relationships that I can see intuitively.” Before we just give up on Decision Trees, let’s look at a counterintuitive way of building our trees that turns out to make them much more accurate. 79",Book 3_2036060.pdf,80,"Here are the notes in advanced markdown format:

**Decision Trees and Data Quality**
=====================================

**Important Considerations**
---------------------------

* **High-quality data is essential**: More data is not always better; high-quality data is what matters.
* **Susceptible to outliers**: Decision Trees are prone to outliers in the data, which can affect accuracy.
* **Limitations in capturing relationships**: Decision Trees may struggle to capture higher-order features and relationships that are intuitively obvious.

**How Decision Trees Work**
---------------------------

* **Series of if...then statements**: Decision Trees build a series of if...then statements using a hard decision boundary.
* **Attribute-based decision making**: Decision Trees make decisions based on attribute values.

**Challenges and Limitations**
-----------------------------

* **Overlapping attributes**: Decision Trees can struggle when categories share many common attributes.
* **Insufficiency in capturing relationships**: Decision Trees may not capture complex relationships that are intuitively obvious.

**Improving Decision Trees**
----------------------------

* **Counterintuitive approach**: There is a way to build Decision Trees that can make them more accurate (to be discussed further)."
"We can dramatically increase the accuracy of a complex Decision Tree through the application of Random Forest. When you first hear this, you are likely doubtful. Your first thought might be, “How will more than one Decision Tree be any better than a single Decision Tree?” Your second thought might be, “And if it’s somehow random, how can that help? I need deterministic answers, not random ones!” These are both valid concerns, but let’s just set them aside for now. The Random Forest approach allows us to define some number of trees 𝑥that will be generated. We also have the ability to define the maximum depth for any tree and the number of features that each tree will use to train. If you’re paying attention, that sounds interesting. Are you asking, “Are you saying that the trees all look at different features?” Not quite, but pretty close! Once the trees have been trained, the classification process looks slightly different from what we’ve seen in Decision Trees. Each tree is given a copy of the sample to be classified. Each tree makes a determination and classifies that sample. Each tree gets one vote as to the final classification of the sample. Whichever category has the greatest consensus is determined to be the correct classifi- cation. 80",Book 3_2036060.pdf,81,"Here are the notes on Random Forest in advanced bullet-point markdown format:

"How, then, are these trees generated? We know that they cannot be the same. There would be no value in getting 100 identical trees to vote; they would always come up with the same answer. The way that we approach the training involves a process called Bootstrap Aggregating , frequently referred to as Bagging. Bagging Let’s try to describe the process. Let’s imagine that we have some set of training data 𝑋. The dataset has 𝑛samples total, and each sample in that dataset is comprised of 𝑚attributes or features. To begin the training process, we define the number of trees that we wish to generate and the number of features that each tree will use in its decision-making process. For simplicity, let’s say that we are creating three trees, each of which will use two features. Further, let us define 𝑋as follows: Gender Weight Height Age Education Smoker Alcohol Use Diabetic M 150 67 46 14 0 52 No F 135 62 38 18 0 26 No F 161 67 58 12 0 52 Yes M 187 68 52 18 0 365 No F 129 60 24 14 1 365 Yes M 220 72 42 12 1 365 Yes Our goal is to generate a model that can accurately predict whether or not someone is prone to or suffers from diabetes based on several known facts. We can see that in 𝑋,𝑛 = 6 and 𝑚 = 71. We 1Note that the last column, ”Diabetic,” isn’t being counted as a feature; this is the ground truth classification label for the specific row. 81",Book 3_2036060.pdf,82,"Here are the notes on the topic of generating decision trees using Bootstrap Aggregating (Bagging) in advanced markdown format:

**Bootstrap Aggregating (Bagging)**

**Generating Decision Trees**
--------------

* Goal: create multiple decision trees that vote to make a prediction
* Reason: identical trees would always produce the same answer, providing no value

**Bagging Process**
--------------

* Define:
	+ Number of trees to generate
	+ Number of features each tree will use in decision-making
* Example:
	+ Generate 3 trees, each using 2 features
* **Training Data** (`𝑋`)
	+ `𝑛` samples (rows)

"now set about generating our trees. We said that we are defining three trees of two features each. For our first tree, we randomly select the columns Gender and Age. Next, we randomly select 𝑛 rows of data. “Now wait,” you say, “There are already 𝑛rows of data. What do you mean ‘randomly select’ them?” A fair question. Here’s what we mean. What we are doing is bagging. When we do this, it is entirely possible, even probable, that a single row will end up being repeated in the training data for this tree. That’s completely OK. What we’re doing, in a sense, is simulating some augmentation of our dataset. Let’s imagine that we randomly select the following: Gender Age Diabetic M 46 No F 38 No M 46 No M 52 No F 24 Yes F 24 Yes We now train our first tree. When that finishes, we train another tree. Once again, we randomly select 𝑛rows to use for training, allowing duplication, and select some random number of features from those rows. A second tree is generated, and so on. When we are all done, we have three trees, each of which has been trained using slightly different data. Even if multiple trees use the same features, it is very unlikely that they were trained with exactly the same data. The result of this is that it smooths out any noise in the data, allowing us to better predict an outcome for an unknown piece of data. 82",Book 3_2036060.pdf,83,"Here are the summary notes in advanced bullet-point markdown format:

----------

* We have three trees, each trained using different data.

"What cautions do we need to be aware of? The biggest caution is that it is very tempting to allow each tree to use a large number of features. This actually serves to work against you. The greater number of features used in each tree, the greater the likelihood that your model will overfit the data. Overfitting means that our model will perform very well with the training data, but it will perform very poorly with anything else. In other words, our model has learned how to identify and classify only the training data. We must always avoid this. Creating trees with many features also tends to increase the likelihood that we will have nearly identical trees. Since the training data is also randomized, they might not be exactly the same, but they can end up being very close. Another trade-off is that large numbers of trees tend to lead to better predictions, but large numbers of trees also end up being computationally costly. When we discussed Decision Trees, we men- tioned that an advantage of them is that there is no difficult mathematics involved. While this is a plus, it means that transitioning to a Random Forest approach becomes expensive. Other more heav- ily mathematics-based modeling tools are expensive at a small scale, but the cost does not really increase since we aren’t creating hundreds of models. With Random Forest, we are taking a fairly inexpensive model and duplicating hundreds or thousands of times, ending up with something that does not optimize well. How many trees are too many? There’s no hard and fast rule. Experimentation is required with your specific problem. If 10,000 trees give us 95.6% accuracy and 100 trees give us 94.8% accuracy, is that added 1.2% worth the computation involved in 9,900 additional trees? This is a question that you must answer for yourself and your problem. 83",Book 3_2036060.pdf,84,"Here are the notes in advanced bullet-point format:

**Cautions with Random Forests**
================================================

* **Overfitting**: Using too many features in each tree can lead to overfitting, where the model performs well on training data but poorly on new data.
	+ **Risk of overfitting increases with the number of features used**
* **Tree similarity**: Creating trees with many features can result in nearly identical trees, which can affect performance.
* **Computational cost**: Using a large number of trees can be computationally expensive.
	+ **Cost increases with the number of trees**
* **No hard and fast rule**: The optimal number of trees depends on the specific problem and requires experimentation.

* **Key consideration**: Is the added accuracy gained by using more trees worth the computational cost?

"What have we accomplished in this volume of the course? We have learned how to use some very powerful tools for exploring and understanding our data. We have learned how to use tools that allow us to identify similarities in our data, and we have learned how to use some more advanced techniques to find hidden correlations and perform dimensionality reduction on our data. Along the way, we have had the opportunity to experiment with clustering. Specifically, we have had the opportunity to realize that figuring out how to define our features in such a way that the clustering is useful can be very challenging! Hopefully, we learned that experimentation is very important. We clearly understand now that, while general solutions are wonderful when we can build them and they work for us, in terms of applied data science and machine learning, it is far more important to find something that works to solve the problem that we have. 85",Book 3_2036060.pdf,86,"**Course Takeaways**

"Another thing that you have either figured out or are beginning to figure out is that all of machine learning today is just math. Everything that was covered in this volume is firmly rooted in math- ematics. Some of it, such as the mathematics of Decision Trees, is quite basic. Others, such as Primary Component Analysis, is much more advanced. We will find that this pattern continues to be true, though the mathematics are generally more complex as we embark into discussions of neural networks. Something else that you may have noticed is that using a clustering algorithm isn’t difficult, but generating something useful out of that clustering algorithm is. While a data scientist or statistician would always point you at unsupervised methods when you are seeking to find anomalies, we are realizing that that is far more difficult than it sounds. Certainly, the clustering techniques make anomalies pop out… but why are they anomalies? We are interested in security anomalies, and we recognize that these are not always the same as statis- tical anomalies. It depends greatly on your data and where you collect it from. If we are looking at internet-facing data, we will often find that the normal traffic shows up as anomalies, and the malicious traffic shows up as the cluster(s)! In the following volume, we will take up this problem again. As we will see, there are some simple things that we can do with supervised learning techniques that can allow us to identify anomalies that are of interest to us. 86",Book 3_2036060.pdf,87,"**Machine Learning and Mathematics**

Instead, these are intended to be personal exploration projects. All of the challenges expand on one or more things covered during that portion of the course (and may draw on things from previous sections). They are intended to give you projects to work on when you have time, each of which will hone your skills, expand your knowledge, and sometimes, improve on a solution given in the course.

"Toward Deep Learning Deep learning neural networks are among the most modern methods of Machine Learning. This field has undergone a tremendous amount of change in the last two decades! In the past (say, the 1990s and early 2000s), Machine Learning was all about creating a system where we would provide data and a set of rules governing relationships in that data, and the machine (or program) would produce a set of predictions about that data. If you have ever used an “Expert System,” which were all the rage into 2000 or so, this is how that system worked. A programmer spent a lot of time analyzing the data and wrote a whole bunch of rules, often in the form of a decision tree that was then used by the system to create predictions. The problem with this is that the program cannot “learn” how to handle new data; the programmer must create new rules. The ideas behind deep learning and neural networks have actually been around for a couple of decades, but it’s only since the evolution of high-end graphics cards that we could implement them practically. This might seem entirely unrelated, but the modern approaches to deep learning make heavy use of linear algebra techniques. High-end graphics cards, specifically GPUs (Graphics Pro- cessing Units), are highly optimized vector processors. That term might sound familiar! Remember, we said that our array of values was really a multidimensional vector. Anyway, the video game industry largely created an enormous market opportunity, resulting in lots of research and development into high-end vector processors for graphics, which make use of quaternions (four-dimensional vectors… OK… A quaternion is something much more complicated and specific than that, but just go with it if you’re in the know…￿) for high-speed 3D translations. These devices, however, are perfect for handling any kind of general high-dimensional vector arith- metic (Linear Algebra)! 5",Book 4_2036060.pdf,6,"Here are the notes in advanced bullet-point format:

**Machine Learning and Deep Learning**
=====================================

* **Machine Learning**: Creating a system that provides data and rules governing relationships in that data to produce predictions.
* **Traditional Approach**: Programmer analyzes data, writes rules (often in the form of a decision tree), and the system makes predictions.
	+ Limitation: System cannot ""learn"" from new data; programmer must create new rules.

**Evolution of Deep Learning**

* **Neural Networks**: Ideas have been around for decades, but only recently became practical with the evolution of high-end graphics cards (GPUs).

"What does this mean? It means that we are now able to use commodity hardware to implement these algorithms. This allows us to feed data and predictions to these algorithms and the algorithms can give us a set of rules1! This represents a real innovation in Machine Learning! 1Or, as you are likely aware at this point, some kind of mapping or translation function. 6",Book 4_2036060.pdf,7,"Here are the notes in advanced bullet-point markdown format:

"Linear Regression We have realized that machine learning, as it stands today, is largely a field of applied mathematics and statistics. Deep learning is no different. To begin our investigation, however, we will begin with a topic that seems unrelated but turns out to be at the heart of how our neural networks function. We’re going to begin by talking about linear regression. This is yet another example of machine learning through mathematics. The name, in this case, has a very straightforward meaning: Linear, involving straight lines, and regression, finding some continuous value or function. Linear regressions, and regression fitting more generally, are used for many tasks involving predic- tion. For example, if we were to look at the cost of housing, it seems reasonable that the cost will go up relative to the quality and availability of public services. This is one of the reasons that housing in the New York metropolitan area is so much higher than it is in Saskatoon in Canada. How these variables are related is covariance, which we have already covered. Finding a function into which we can plug these values and come up with some new continuous value that makes some useful prediction is what is new. When we talk about a linear regression, we are trying to come up with the formula for a line that best captures the relationship or behavior of our data. For our purposes, perhaps we want to measure the number of bytes per second passing across a network link. A linear regression could potentially help us to predict how many bytes per second our network is likely to carry a year from now, allowing us to plan accordingly. When we talk about lines, we can call back to the basic algebra and geometry that you learned in secondary school: 7",Book 4_2036060.pdf,8,"Here are the notes on Linear Regression in advanced bullet-point markdown format:

"𝑦 = 𝑚𝑥+𝑏 If you were educated in Europe or almost anywhere other than the United States, you may have seen this formula as: 𝑦 = 𝑎𝑥+𝑐 Whether we use 𝑎or𝑚,𝑏or𝑐, the formula expresses the same relationship. You probably recognize this expression as the general formula for a line written in slope-intercept form. In this expression, 𝑥is the x coordinate1,𝑦is the y coordinate2,𝑚is the slope of the line3and𝑏is the y intercept4. This same formula can also be written using f(x) to replace y. There’s really no difference; this just gives us a handy way to say that f(x) represents the set of operations that we perform on x to produce y.

"Regression problems are related to but different from classification and categorization problems. Since a regression involves finding a formula that can be used to express a continuous value, it is well suited to solving problems like this: Given[1,2,4,8,16,32,64,128,?] Which comes next in this series? Hopefully, you can look at that list of numbers and readily identify that each value is double the preceding value in the list. In this case, we have used integers, which makes this easy to see, but this same relationship could hold true for any list of numbers. A regression would reveal that the general formula would be: 𝑓(𝑥) = 2𝑥 The example here is very simple and we can quickly identify a specific formula that gives every value exactly, even values that do not yet appear. This is at the heart of what we are attempting to do with a regression. We are attempting to find some function 𝑓(𝑥) that best fits the data. 9",Book 4_2036060.pdf,10,"**Regression Problems**

"Translating this into something that we can apply in the real world, consider the graph in the slide. If this graph represents the number of bytes of data observed passing over the network at different time intervals, could we work out some function that best fits this data? The chances that the function predicts each value exactly is quite low. Even if it were possible to do so, it might not be wise. We’ll look at why this leads to trouble after we solve the linear regression. Still, finding some function that generalizes this data would be useful. An important question might be, “How quickly is our volume of data increasing?” One of the reasons that we might care about this is for future planning and forecasting. You would likely prefer to predict when your organization will potentially exceed current network capacity and plan upgrades ahead of time. Another reason such a function might be useful would be to look for indications of threats. Could a massive and unexpected spike in data flow indicate an exfiltration? Could the number of bytes accessed per hour on our file server indicate that ransomware is currently encrypting the file server? 10",Book 4_2036060.pdf,11,"Here are the advanced bullet-point notes summarizing the topic:
### **Linear Regression and Network Data Analysis**

* **Motivation**: Find a function that generalizes network data to predict future trends and identify potential issues
* **Goal**: Determine a function that best fits the data representing the number of bytes of data observed over time
* **Importance**:
	+ **Future planning and forecasting**: Predict when network capacity will be exceeded and plan upgrades accordingly
	+ **Threat detection**: Identify unexpected spikes in data flow as indicators of potential security threats (e.g., exfiltration) or malware infections (e.g., ransomware)
* **Challenges**:
	+ **Limited accuracy**: The function may not predict each value exactly
	+ **Overfitting**: A function that fits the data too closely may not generalize well to new, unseen data
* **Next Steps**: Solve the linear regression problem to find a function that balances accuracy and generalizability"
"Optimizing by Minimizing Loss Intuitively, we could simply try to draw a line that represents the average number of bytes of increase. While we can visually estimate where that line should go, a much better approach would be for us to apply some mathematics to the problem. The most common way to solve this problem, linear regression, is to determine what the average error is between our line that approximates the data and the actual data. When we say error here, all that it means is the difference between the approximation and the actual data. For example, imagine that our estimate is that hour 10 will have 2.4x104 bytes. Yet, the actual measured number of bytes comes in at 3.6x104. We can work out the difference between these two, which represents the amount of error. What we’d really like to do is work out the formula for a line that minimizes the error over the length of the entire line rather than for a specific point. We cannot simply add up the amount of error for every point. What if one point is off by +1,000,000, but another point is off by -1,000,000? If we simply add those together, we would inaccurately conclude that there was no error at all! The function most frequently used to measure this error, or loss, is Mean Squared Error: 1 𝑛𝑛 ∑ 𝑖=0(𝑦𝑖− ̂ 𝑦)2 This should look very familiar at this point. For example, you should immediately look at (𝑦𝑖− ̂ 𝑦) and think, “That looks like a distance!” If you did, that’s awesome! If you didn’t, that’s OK… but 11",Book 4_2036060.pdf,12,"Here are the notes in advanced bullet-point markdown format:
##### **Optimizing by Minimizing Loss**

* **Intuition vs. Mathematical Approach**
	+ Can visually estimate the average increase in bytes, but a mathematical approach is better
	+ Linear regression: determine average error between the approximated line and actual data
* **Error**
	+ Difference between the approximation and actual data
	+ Example: estimated 2.4x10^4 bytes vs. actual 3.6x10^4 bytes, error = 3.6x10^4 - 2.4x10^4
* **Minimizing Error**
	+ Want to find a formula for a line that minimizes error over the entire length
	+ Can't simply add up errors, as positive and negative errors could cancel out
* **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**
	+ Frequently used function to measure error or loss
	+ Formula: 1/n \* ∑(yi - ŷ)^2
	+ **Distance Analogy**: (yi - ŷ) represents a distance
	+ MSE is a measure of the average distance between actual and predicted values squared"
"you should see it now. It is understandable if you are a bit thrown off by ̂ 𝑦, which is a new symbol for us. Even though mathematics should really be a universal language, and even though there are con- ventions for how certain formulas and other things are written, you will find that different fields will notate the same type of formula in different ways. If we were doing something with Linear Algebra at the moment, ̂ 𝑦would likely be interpreted as, “the unit vector along axis 𝑦.” In this case, however, machine learning borrows from statistical notation. In the field of statistics, we use 𝑦to indicate an outcome. In the Mean Squared Error formula, 𝑦𝑖 represents the ground-truth value of 𝑦that corresponds to 𝑥𝑖. Thê 𝑦represents our predicted value. In other words, ̂ 𝑦represents the output of our prediction function, our neural network, or whatever it is that we are using to generate values. To summarize this, 𝑦𝑖− ̂ 𝑦finds the difference, or linear distance, between our prediction and ground truth. Why is this value being squared? Consider this: 𝑛 ∑ 𝑖=1(𝑦𝑖− ̂ 𝑦) This expresses the sum of the differences between the ground-truth values and the predictions. What if we had the following values: y y hat Difference 2 1 1 3 4 -1 4 5 -1 5 5 0 6 5 1 7 9 -2 8 6 2 What is the sum of these differences? 0. Does this mean that our function perfectly predicts the data? While it might imply this, clearly our function isn’t perfect. Back to our previous question: Why is the difference squared? By squaring each difference, we preserve the magnitude of the difference. In practical terms, this means that our error function provides us with a measure of the error, or of loss, but there are no units attached to this value. The value simply represents an arbitrary measure of the error. The number is only meaningful in the context of another loss value generated using the same formula from the same dataset. The overall strategy of a linear regression algorithm is to minimize the value of this loss function. 12",Book 4_2036060.pdf,13,"Here are the notes on the provided passage in advanced bullet-point markdown format:

"Polyfit The NumPy library provides the very useful polyfit() function. This function allows us to pass in a set of𝑥and𝑦values. NumPy then performs a regression analysis, working out a function that best fits the data by minimizing the loss between the ground-truth data provided and the predicted data that the function generates. This function allows us to specify that we would like to generate a function with an arbitrary degree or order1. What does this mean? Consider the following functions: 𝑓(𝑥) = 𝑥+1 𝑓(𝑥) = −2𝑥2+2𝑥−1 𝑓(𝑥) = 4𝑥3+𝑥2+𝑥−9 𝑓(𝑥) = 9𝑥6+2𝑥3−1 2𝑥−1 These functions are of varying degrees. The first function is a first-degree function. The second is second-degree, the third is third-degree, and the fourth is a sixth-degree equation. The degree of an equation is the highest power to which the independent variable2is raised. 1We are being somewhat loose here. Technically, we are speaking about the *degree* of the equation. Order is more typically applied to differential equations and expresses the highest order derivative within the equation. 2𝑥, in this case. 13",Book 4_2036060.pdf,14,"Here are the notes on the topic of Polyfit in the NumPy library:

**Polyfit Function in NumPy**
================================

### Description

* The `polyfit` function in the NumPy library performs a regression analysis on a set of x and y values.
* It generates a function that best fits the data by minimizing the loss between the ground-truth data and the predicted data.

### Functionality

* The function allows the specification of an arbitrary degree or order.
* The degree of the equation is the highest power to which the independent variable is raised.

### Examples of Functions with Varying Degrees
------------------------------------------

* **First-degree function**: 𝑓(𝑥) = 𝑥 + 1
* **Second-degree function**: 𝑓(𝑥) = −2𝑥² + 2𝑥 − 1
* **Third-degree function**: 𝑓(𝑥) = 4𝑥³ + 𝑥² + 𝑥 − 9
* **Sixth-degree function**: 𝑓(𝑥) = 9𝑥⁶ + 2𝑥³ − 1/2𝑥 − 1

### Note on Degree vs. Order
-------------------------

* The **degree** of an equation refers to the highest power to which the independent variable is raised.
* **Order** is typically applied to differential equations and expresses the highest order derivative within the equation."
"We can use the polyfit function to come up with an array of two values representing the coefficients of a first-degree equation that best fits our data. Those two values can be plugged into the standard formula for a line as the coefficients for each term. This means that we now know the slope and the y-intercept for the line that NumPy thinks minimizes the error (or loss) between the approximation and the actual data. NumPy provides the poly1d() convenience function that accepts the array of coefficients and returns a function that can be used to calculate values. This is headed somewhere really big. We’re not ready to tell you where it’s heading or how it applies, so let’s just recap what you should know right now. Linear regression is an algorithm that is used to calculate the coefficients that represent the formula for a line that approximates the relationship between two values. This line is the best fit for the data. We know this because this line minimizes the error, or loss, between the approximation and the actual data over the entire length of the line. 14",Book 4_2036060.pdf,15,"**Linear Regression Notes**

"Before we jump straight to overfitting, let’s think about this a bit more deeply. What we’ve done so far is linear regression, which by definition uses a straight line. Looking at the data, though, it is apparent that a straight line is unlikely to capture what appears to be a non-linear growth trend. Over time, the error will likely become larger and larger. What if we used higher-order equations to attempt to model the data? This seems like a great intuition! What if we tried a second- or third-order equation? Would that better represent the data? To try this, we will make use of the polyfit function again. Previously, we asked it to create a first- order equation (a line). Let’s ask it to create a second-, a third-, and a fifteenth-order equation to represent our data! The line wasn’t bad, so clearly more or higher orders must be better! You can see that in the notebook, we have started with a numerical approach. Using the same loss function, we ask it to compare the loss or error for our first-, second-, third-, and fifteenth-order equations. We can see that the error or loss is definitely going down!! That must be good, right? Let’s have a look at the graphs of these functions. 15",Book 4_2036060.pdf,16,"Here are the notes on the provided passage in advanced bullet-point format:

**Overfitting and Polynomial Regression**
================================================

* **Limitations of Linear Regression**: Linear regression uses a straight line to model data, which may not capture non-linear growth trends.
* **Intuition**: Using higher-order equations (e.g., second- or third-order) to better represent non-linear data.
* **Polynomial Regression**: Use of polyfit function to create higher-order equations:
	+ **First-order equation**: A line (previously used)
	+ **Higher-order equations**: Second-, third-, and fifteenth-order equations to model data
* **Error Analysis**: Comparing loss or error for different order equations:
	+ **Error decreases**: Loss or error decreases as order of equation increases
	+ **But is it good?**: Decreasing error does not necessarily imply better modeling
* **Visualizing Functions**: Graphing the functions to visualize the relationships

"The second-order equation definitely looks better. It is now capturing at least some of the data to the left, though it seems a bit high at hour ero. More importantly, we can see that as time goes by, this is a much better approximation of the data! It is clearly curving up, following the growth trend in our ground-truth data more closely. 16",Book 4_2036060.pdf,17,"Here are the notes in advanced bullet-point markdown format:

**Second-Order Equation**
==========================

* **Improvement over previous equation**: Captures at least some of the data to the left
* **Areas for improvement**:
	+ High at hour zero (hour ero)
* **Strengths**:
	+ **Better approximation of data**: Follows growth trend in ground-truth data more closely
	+ **Captures curvature**: Curves up, matching growth trend in data"
"If a second-order polynomial is better, a third-order must be even better. Looking at the graph, it is! Notice that the dotted line drops down toward ero near hour ero, and it more closely follows the increase over time! If a third-order equation is this much better, let’s just crank this way up! 17",Book 4_2036060.pdf,18,"**Polynomial Regression Notes**
=============================

### Comparison of Polynomial Orders
#### Second-Order vs. Third-Order Polynomials

* A second-order polynomial is not sufficient, implying that a third-order polynomial is a better fit.
* The graph shows that the third-order polynomial (dotted line) is a closer fit to the data, especially near hour 0.
* The third-order polynomial **more closely follows the increase over time**.

### Implication
* If a third-order equation is significantly better, it is reasonable to assume that an even higher-order polynomial (e.g., 17th-order) would be an even better fit."
"Our fifteenth-order1equation, however, looks less promising. While it appears to be doing good things toward hour ero, the farther we go to the right, the more the function begins to oscillate in a way that look less and less correct. Finally, it seems to shoot off to infinity! It should be apparent that the fifteenth-order equation is nota good selection for future predictions with this dataset. Even so, recall that this function had the lowest overall error. 1We have stopped at a fifteenth-order equation because Python starts to experience overflows with this data at this point on a 64-bit system. 18",Book 4_2036060.pdf,19,"**Evaluating the Fifteenth-Order Equation**
=============================================

* The fifteenth-order equation appears to be problematic for predicting future values:
	+ At first, it seems to perform well, but as it progresses, it starts to oscillate and becomes less accurate.
	+ The function eventually shoots off to infinity, indicating that it is not suitable for making future predictions with this dataset.
* Despite having the lowest overall error, the fifteenth-order equation is not a good choice for future predictions.
* **Limitations of Python**: Python experiences overflows with this data at the fifteenth-order equation on a 64-bit system, which is why we stopped at this point."

"Neural Networks When we oom way in and look at the behavior of the fifteenth-order function generated by poly- fit() , we can get a much better feeling, or intuition, about what’s happening. Have you heard the English expression, “Missing the forest for the trees?” In a sense, that’s what has happened. This fifteenth-order function really isn’t approximating the entirety of the data anymore. Instead, it is just minimizing the error at specific points in our data. To be fair, you might read that and think, “Well, isn’t that what it’s supposed to do?” Yes. However, the larger goal is to generate a function that approximates the overall behavior rather than finding a function that hits the majority of the points exactly. Thinking of the analogy about forests and trees, it is so focused on the trees that it can no longer see the forest or the overall behavior. Of course, the function can’t seeanything at all. The behavior that we are observing, though, can be described as overfitting. Our function is trying to hit every single point that it can rather than trying to approximate the overall behavior of the data. When working with machine learning algorithms, if we overtrain or overfit, our model will be exceptionally good at properly categorizing, classifying, or predicting the training data, but it will perform very poorly with real-world data. This tells us a couple of things. First, overfitting is bad! If we overfit, we can have a model that seems great in the lab but works very poorly in practice. This doesn’t always mean that the model itself is bad. That same model may work far better if we stop the training process sooner. There’s another thing this tells us. When we are monitoring the loss function, we should probably stop training when the error or loss stops changing or even increases. When the loss number stops 21",Book 4_2036060.pdf,22,"Here are the notes on Neural Networks in advanced markdown format:
### Overfitting in Neural Networks
#### Definition of Overfitting
* **Overfitting**: when a model is too complex and tries to fit every point in the training data, rather than approximating the overall behavior.

#### Consequences of Overfitting
* **Poor performance on real-world data**: a model that is overfit may perform well on the training data but poorly on new, unseen data.
* **Not necessarily a bad model**: stopping the training process sooner may improve the model's performance.

#### Identifying Overfitting
* **Monitor the loss function**: stop training when the error or loss stops changing or increases.

#### Analogy: Missing the Forest for the Trees
* Focusing too much on individual points (trees) rather than the overall behavior (forest) can lead to overfitting.
* A model that overfits is like trying to hit every single point exactly, rather than approximating the overall behavior of the data.

#### Machine Learning Goals
* The larger goal is to generate a function that approximates the overall behavior of the data, rather than finding a function that hits the majority of the points exactly."

"Just to drive this point home, take a look at the predictive capability of our fifteenth-order equation. In the short term, it had the lowest overall error. If we look out to 30 hours after the sample data, you can see that it predicts that the network data will plummet to ero bytes somewhere around hour 78! This is clearly wrong. 23",Book 4_2036060.pdf,24,"Here are the notes in advanced bullet-point markdown format:

"Let’s summarize where we are so far and some key takeaways. Linear regression is an algorithm or process that is used to attempt to find a line that best fits a set of data points. This means that we are attempting to minimize the error, or the loss, between the actual data and the line itself. Using higher-order functions can sometimes approximate or fit the data much better. This leads to a lower loss, or error. Whether we are using a linear regression or a higher-order regression, when the computer uses the algorithm to revise the coefficients used in the function to minimize the loss, this process is called learning. There is a risk that we can cross over from approximating (or fitting) the data to overfitting, which simply means that we now fit our training data so well that we are unlikely to have captured useful correlations, making the model very unreliable for predicting future events. 24",Book 4_2036060.pdf,25,"Here are the notes on Linear Regression and Key Takeaways in advanced markdown format:

"When we start building neural networks, we are striving to balance a number of competing problems. One of these is that we want to provide the model for all of the important features from our data so that it can best learn how to model the behavior. Especially when starting out, this can lead to us throwing every scrap of data that we can find at the model. This isn’t a good approach. On the one hand, this will make the model more complex and the model will require significantly more processing for the same problem. On the other hand, we are likely including irrelevant data. This can lead to the model discovering apparent correlations that are coincidental rather than real. The result can be that our model appears to work quite well, but under the hood, it is using faulty criteria1for its decision making. Bias vs. Variance Another of the issues that we are trying to balance is that of Bias. Bias is a measure of how well we learn versus consistency. If our model has high bias, it means that the training might take a long time, the overall accuracy on the training data might not be great, but it is very consistent in its predictions. To be specific, imagine a model that has a 75% accuracy after training. Try as we might, we cannot get it to improve its accuracy through additional learning. However, the model accurately produces results on any real-world data that we pass into between 74% and 76% of the time. If the model has low bias, this likely means that training was fairly straightforward, perhaps even 1To draw on our previous experience with Decision Trees, this would be like performing training for fruit classifi- cation where we provide the system with features that include the color of the soil, the rockiness of the soil, the average rainfall over 60 days, the average air temperature, etc. You can easily see that the average rainfall over 60 days has nothing to do with whether the fruit in question is a grape or a pear. The algorithm, however, may discover a false correlation and begin to believe that pears only grow where there is low rainfall compared to grapes. 25",Book 4_2036060.pdf,26,"Here are the notes on the topic of balancing competing problems in building neural networks:

* **Balancing Competing Problems**
	+ We want to provide the model with all important features from the data to model the behavior.
	+ However, throwing all available data at the model can lead to:
		- Model complexity and increased processing requirements
		- Inclusion of irrelevant data, leading to:
			- Apparent correlations that are coincidental rather than real
			- Model decision making based on faulty criteria

* **Bias vs. Variance**
	+ **Bias**: measures how well the model learns vs. consistency
	+ High bias:
		- Training takes a long time
		- Low accuracy on training data
		- Consistent predictions (e.g., 74%-76% accuracy on real-world data)
	+ Low bias:
		- Training is straightforward
		- Higher accuracy on training data
	+ Example of high bias: a model that achieves 75% accuracy but cannot improve further
	+ Example of how bias can lead to incorrect correlations: considering irrelevant features (e.g., soil color, rainfall) in fruit classification"
"resulting in a model with 92% accuracy1. This seems far superior, but the model proves to be very inconsistent. In other words, when applied to real-world data, the accuracy averages out to be 90%, perhaps, but there are datasets where it is only 40% accurate, far worse than the high bias model. The other major issue that we are balancing is the variance . Variance here is related to but not the same as how we’ve used this word previously in this course. If a model has low variance , it is usually a very simple model. Lower variance seems as though it would be better since it will be faster and more efficient, but if it is too simple, it will be difficult to learn a useful set of parameters to make accurate predictions. Ahigh variance model will typically be more complex. Being more complex, it has the potential to better map more complex features of our data. If it is too complex, however, it is very easy to overfit our data. In this case, an overly complex model will likely begin to memorize the training data rather than learn to make predictions. 1The actual accuracy doesn’t matter here. The point is that it is much more accurate than the high bias model. 26",Book 4_2036060.pdf,27,"Here are the notes on the topic of model accuracy and bias-variance tradeoff:

**Model Accuracy and Bias-Variance Tradeoff**

"Let’s take what we’ve said about bias and variance and clearly state more formal definitions: •Bias is a measure of the difficulty a linear model has in learning or fitting a non-linear dataset. •V ariance has to do with the overall flexibility of the model. More flexibility seems good, but too much flexibility means that we are memorizing. In case you have not realized it already, working with machine learning techniques is very much an empirical1science. 1Empirical implies that results are determined through experimentation. Compare this to mathematics generally. The reason that we know that the area of a sphere is4 3𝜋𝑟3is not a matter of experimentation. Instead, rigorous proofs have been developed that prove that this is true for all spheres, not just a few specific spheres. Empirical fields, such as machine learning, require experimentation to determine best-practice methods. There are no proofs available, so instead what is ”best” is typically determined by the consensus of the community experimenting with these problems. 27",Book 4_2036060.pdf,28,"**Machine Learning: Bias and Variance**
=====================================

**Definitions**
-------------

* **Bias**: Measure of a linear model's difficulty in learning or fitting a non-linear dataset.
* **Variance**: Measure of a model's overall flexibility; high flexibility can lead to **memorization**.

**Machine Learning as an Empirical Science**
-----------------------------------------

* **Empirical**: Results determined through **experimentation**, unlike mathematics which relies on **rigorous proofs**.
* In machine learning, **best-practice methods** are determined by **consensus of the community** through experimentation, as there are no **proofs** available.

"It can help to understand how these terms relate and what they describe by looking at a more visual example. In the slide, we have three images. The image to the left shows the plot of a series of data that we have for which we would like to create a model and perform predictions. The data has been split into a training set and a testing set. On the right we look at the performance of two models, visualized by the red line. In the top model, we can see that the model is very reliable and has almost no variation. It is always a little bit wrong, but it is always wrong by nearly the identical amount. This is a very high bias model. An example would be a linear regression. The model isn’t very flexible, but it’s predictions are very reliable. On the bottom right we have a second, much lower bias model. This model is very flexible. When we train the model it generates predictions that follow the red line. Notice that while there is more flexibility (lower bias), the variance in accuracy is much higher. Sometimes the model is exactly right with no loss at all. Other times it is very far from the test data. While we are usually trying to balance these two things and often have to trade off one for the other, ideally we would be able to find a model that exhibits both low bias and low variance. Ideal solutions of this sort can be very difficult to find with complex data. 28",Book 4_2036060.pdf,29,"**Model Evaluation: Bias and Variance**
=====================================

### Key Concepts
* **Bias**: Measure of how far off a model's predictions are from the actual values on average
* **Variance**: Measure of how scattered a model's predictions are from each other

* Three images:
	+ Left: Plot of data split into training and testing sets

			- Sometimes exactly right, sometimes far from test data

### Goal
* Find a model that balances **bias** and **variance** to achieve both reliability and flexibility"
"What Are Rules? When we say that the algorithm will give us rules, what exactly do we mean? You might think, “If it’s round and if it’s red, it’s an apple.” While this is a set of rules, it is a very high-level set of rules. “Red” and “round” are very high-level abstractions. A computer would have to understand what red means and what round means before rules like this could ever be generated1. Even so, this is effectively what’s happening at a mathematics level. What if we have a lot of facts about some problem and we are able to transform those facts into numbers? What if we use those numbers to create, not one regression analysis, but multiple simul- taneous regression analyses? This is at the heart of what deep learning means today. When we talk about deep learning, we need to provide a set of features that will be used for learning. These features are the facts that we will feed in. More specifically, the features will ultimately be represented as multidimensional vectors (arrays of values). When we try to transform that data from a set of features to some set of predictions (possibly cate- gories), we are coming up with labels. In fact, think of it this way: We are trying to come up with an equation that, when we feed the features into it, it will transform the features into a label. What do we mean by transform? Well, remember 𝑦 = 𝑚𝑥+𝑏 . This formula takes a value 𝑥and translates or transforms it into a corresponding value for 𝑦. That’s it! Except that our vectors might have 10,000 features! Consider this formula: 1Never mind that the computer doesn’t know what an apple is! 29",Book 4_2036060.pdf,30,"Here are the notes on ""What Are Rules?"" in advanced bullet-point markdown format:

"̂𝑌 = 𝜎(𝑤𝑋 +𝑏) Can you identify anything familiar in the structure of that equation? We have run into ̂ 𝑦before, so it seems reasonable that ̂𝑌is related. In fact, it is. In mathematics, a lowercase variable such as 𝑦implies that 𝑦is a single value1. Capital letters, such as 𝑋, represent some matrix 𝑋. Putting this together with what we previously learned about the hat symbol and statistics, ̂𝑌represents the matrix2of predictions. Consider the right-hand side of the equation. Our statistics knowledge might lead us to think that 𝜎represents the standard deviation. This is not the case! A big clue is that it is being applied as a function since it is notated as 𝜎(𝑤𝑋 +𝑏) rather than (𝜎𝑤𝑋 +𝜎𝑏) . What it means here is that we are applying some function 𝜎to the result of the expression 𝑤𝑋 +𝑏 . We will return to 𝜎when we discuss activation functions on page 44. Within the parentheses, you should see something very familiar. While the letters have changed somewhat, 𝑤𝑋 + 𝑏 looks an awful lot like the slope-intercept formula for a line. This is a very useful intuition, though the terms are slightly different. 𝑤represents the individual weights within each neuron, which is multiplied by the matrix 𝑋, which represents the features, plus some bias value𝑏. 1Take note that this is not always true. For example, when we considered Euclidian distances, we saw that points are frequently generalized to a single variable. 2In case your mind is thinking that this should read ”vector,” recall that a vector is a special case of a matrix. 30",Book 4_2036060.pdf,31,"Here are the notes in advanced bullet-point markdown format:

"Linear Algebra Optimizations We’ve said several times that all of this makes heavy use of vectors and linear algebra. Linear Algebra provides a systematic way to represent related (or possibly related) mathematics problems as operations on matrices, vectors, and scalar values. Previously, we stated that Linear Algebra is all about transformations. This proves to be a very useful understanding in the context of neural networks. When we build and train a neural network, we are attempting to create a system that can find a transformation from the set of features to some classification or regression. For example, if we pass in a sentence to a model trained to perform translation, the model performs a series of arithmetic operations on the input data that results in a transformation or mapping to a vector or set of vectors representing the translated text. Said more formally, the training process determines the coefficients that transform some set of 𝑛dimensional features into some useful 𝑚dimensional output. 31",Book 4_2036060.pdf,32,"Here are the notes on Linear Algebra Optimizations in advanced markdown format:

As a reminder, TensorFlow is really just a Python API that provides useful abstractions for machine learning. There really isn’t anything magical about it. While TensorFlow implements its own types and classes, we can just view it as a Python library for manipulating vectors. Deep learning today largely centers around the notion of a perceptron. While there are other more specialized types of neurons used in different neural networks, the perceptron generalizes them well. Technically, perceptrons are neurons that are viewed as on or off1. Consider the mathematical definition of a perceptron: 𝑓(𝑥) = {1if(𝑤⋅𝑥+𝑏) > 0 0in all other cases Take note that we find the familiar (𝑤𝑥+𝑏) embedded here, though notated just slightly differently. Also, while a perceptron strictly defines only two cases, this is not true of neurons generally. In some approaches, the degree of activation is important. This could be unbounded, perhaps in some type of continuous regression, or bounded through the application of some function2. All of this means that our time spent learning to think about our data in terms of vectors and matrices was well spent. Solving a problem with a neural network requires that we are able to represent our 1Since they are effectively on or off, they are viewed as binary classifiers ; that is, classifiers that have one of two values. 2In case you are curious, we will discuss functions that are used to govern the output of a neuron a bit later.

"Where does the name TensorFlow come from? We already know that a vector is a special case of a matrix. It turns out that a matrix is just a specific case of a more general construct: A tensor. We need not complicate our definition any more than this. A tensor is effectively a matrix of vectors or a matrix of matrices. This should help explain the name TensorFlow to some degree. Based on the name, this is some kind of software that manipulates sets of vectors. It is important to remind you that in Linear Algebra, which we use to manipulate tensors, our ma- trices have to be of the same shape1or number of dimensions. This means that, if we are going to represent data that has variable length, we must somehow manipulate that data so that it is all of the same length. If we can’t do this, we can’t apply this approach for Machine Learning! This, though, creates a situation that is very common in Machine Learning: It often takes far more effort to massage the data into a condition where you can use it than it does to actually create the Machine Learning model! This is a lesson that we have already learned throughout the class. Adding in neural networks just adds a bit more complexity to the problem. 1This is a bit of an inaccurate generalization. More accurately, matrices and vectors must be of the proper shape to perform operations. We are not going to go through all of the rules governing these interactions since we will not be performing any of the calculations manually. Suffice to say that our data must be the correct shape or TensorFlow simply can’t work with it using the machine learning algorithms. 34",Book 4_2036060.pdf,35,"Here are the notes on the topic of TensorFlow in advanced bullet-point markdown format:

* A tensor can be thought of as a matrix of vectors or a matrix of matrices.

### Origin of the Name TensorFlow
* The name TensorFlow is derived from the concept of tensors and the flow of operations on them.

### Important Considerations in Machine Learning
* In Linear Algebra, matrices must have the same shape or number of dimensions to perform operations.
* In Machine Learning, it is often necessary to manipulate data to make it all the same length to apply algorithms.

"Vectorization One of the approaches to turning variable-length data into static-length vectors is that of vectoriza- tion, of which one-hot1andmulti-hot2encoding are examples. Vectorization means that we are taking the raw data and transforming it into a vector. This naturally implies that we are also converting it into numeric values. In most cases, especially when dealing with deep learning, we will want to convert the data to a value between -1 and 13. This is also known as normalizing the data. Really, this just means that we are scaling the data so that the full range of values is represented by some value between -1 and 1. Let’s explore vectorization and multi-hot encoding with a practical example. Let’s imagine that we want to capture the TCP options in a packet as a set of features. If we look at three different packets, we find that they have different TCP options turned on. Not only are there different options, but the options might even be in a different order. How can we turn these into vectors? 1This implies that a single column out of a set of columns in a vector is turned on, or ”hot”. 2As will soon become apparent, this implies that multiple columns in a set of columns in a vector are turned on, or ”hot”. 3Alternatively, we could convert the data to a value between 0 and 1, which is a subset of the range from -1 to 1. You will find that there are situations where you can break this rule with no apparent consequence. Still, normalizing the values is a good habit to get into. 35",Book 4_2036060.pdf,36,"Here are the notes on vectorization in advanced markdown format:

* **One-Hot Encoding**: a single column out of a set of columns in a vector is turned on, or ""hot""
* **Multi-Hot Encoding**: multiple columns in a set of columns in a vector are turned on, or ""hot""

### Example: TCP Options
* Capturing TCP options in a packet as a set of features
* Converting different TCP options into vectors
	+ Different options may be turned on in different packets
	+ Options may be in a different order
* **Challenge**: turning these into vectors

### Normalizing Data
* **Normalizing data**: converting data to a value between -1 and 1
* **Alternative**: converting data to a value between 0 and 1 (subset of the range from -1 to 1)
* Importance of normalizing data: a good habit to get into"
"What if we were to think of the complete set of possible TCP options as a series of columns in a spreadsheet? Then, for each packet, we set each column to ero if the option isn’t present and to one if the option is present. The advantage of this is that we have taken a variable-length set of options and turned it into a static- length vector! Along the way, we also translated the options into numbers, and those numbers have automatically been normalized since they are either ero or one! Any value that is “hot”, or on, is represented as a 1, while missing values are represented with a 0. Since multiple options can be turned on at the same time, what we have created is a multi-hot representation. Along the way, we have lost the order that the options appeared in. Will this matter? Possibly. This depends on the nature of the problem we are trying to solve and the relationship of the order of the values to that problem. We did mention this other term, one-hot encoding. This is very similar, but not the same. In fact, look at the name. Literally, one thing will be hot. In other words, in the resulting vector, only one element will be set to one, or hot. If we were to one-hot encode the TCP options for the first packet in the slide, we would get the following matrix: ⎡ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎣1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0⎤ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎦ Remember, this matrix represents all of the options present in just one packet as a one-hot encoded matrix.

"Before we dig more deeply into neural networks, it is important that you see that there is nothing magical happening. Remember that we started this section with a linear regression problem to illustrate learning parameters for a function to fit data. We also mentioned that ̂ 𝑦 = 𝜎(𝑤𝑋 + 𝑏) sits at the heart of every neuron in the networks that we have seen so far. How, exactly, does the network “learn?” Before answering that question, you should be clear that we are going to go about solving the related problem differently than you may have been taught in mathematics class. Usually, you are focused on the values of 𝑥and𝑦, typically trying to solve for 𝑥. That is not our goal here. Instead, we can view 𝑦,̂ 𝑦, and𝑥as fixed, or constant, values. Why? Because the 𝑥values represent the input data, over which we have no real control. The 𝑦values represent the ground truth, against which we will be measuring loss. The ̂ 𝑦values represent the predicted values out of our function and are completely defined by the rest of the terms. Which values are we attempting to solve this problem for, then? Rather than attempting to find the typical variables, we are instead attempting to find the parameters . The parameters in this equation are the𝑤and𝑏values, which we often think of as coefficients. If we had only one unknown parameter that we needed to find, this problem would be fairly trivial. In our case, however, we have two unknowns. This complicates the problem substantially. There are potentially infinite possible values for 𝑤and𝑏that, working together, can create each output. How do we find the values of both parameters at the same time? Calculus! Partial Derivatives To solve this problem, we need to examine how the loss behaves relative to each of the parameters. When we use the word “behaves” here, we are talking about how it is changing. Another word that 40",Book 4_2036060.pdf,41,"Here are the summarized notes in advanced bullet-point format:

* Equation: ̂ 𝑦 = 𝜎(𝑤𝑋 + 𝑏) sits at the heart of every neuron in the networks

"we can use to describe how a value changes is𝑥0−𝑦1 𝑥0−𝑥1. You can interpret this as the change in 𝑦 divided by the change in 𝑥. Written another way, we could sayΔ𝑦 Δ𝑥. How does this relate to the parameters, though? We are now talking about a graph where 𝑥and𝑦 describe the loss value relative to either the 𝑤or the𝑏term. We are attempting to measure how that loss is changing. We can simplify all of that notation to what is likely a more familiar term: slope. What is the slope of the loss function relative to the 𝑤or the𝑏term. This brings us to calculus. Calculus has many very useful tools. From our point of view, we can view calculus as providing tools to examine how things are changing. Consider the following function: 𝑦 = 𝑥3+4𝑥2−3𝑥+2 If we are interested in knowing how that function is changing, or what it’s slope is, at any given point, we can calculate it’s derivative . We are not going to walk through a proof, but as was mentioned in the material discussing Fourier transforms, the power rule allows us to work out the derivative (which is really calculating differentials , or the ratio of how things are changing). The result would be: 𝑑𝑦 𝑑𝑥= 2𝑥2+8𝑥−3 Note that we are using𝑑𝑦 𝑑𝑥to indicate the derivative here. Why we are doing so will become apparent very soon. You may also see derivatives notated in other ways. For example, the derivative of 𝑓(𝑥) could be notated as 𝑓′(𝑥). Alternatively, you may also see the derivative of something like 𝑦 = 𝑥3 notated as 𝑦′= 3𝑥2. Before we continue, there is one additional thing to note about the derivative, or slope function, that we have found. The slope always tells you which way is “up”. In other words, it points in the direction that leads to increasing values of 𝑦. If you aren’t sure that this is true, take a moment and plot the following two functions using matplotlib . Figure out what the slope of the two functions are and prove to yourself that the slope indicates which direction leads to an increase in y: 𝑦 = 𝑥𝑦 = −𝑥 With all of this background, we are now ready to dive into calculating how the loss is changing relative to the 𝑤and𝑏parameters in our line function. To update the values of 𝑚and𝑏, we need to know how they should be changed relative to the loss. To find this, we need to calculate the partial derivatives of the MSE function relative to 𝑚and to𝑏. How, you might ask, do we calculate a partial derivative and what is such a thing? When we have a function with two (or more) unknowns, we cannot calculate a simple derivative as we might with a function like 𝑓(𝑥) = 𝑥2. Instead, we must calculate two partial differentials. Partial because each captures only one aspect of the change that is occurring. To calculate these, we 41",Book 4_2036060.pdf,42,"Here are the notes on the topic in advanced bullet-point markdown format:

**Measuring How Values Change**
================================

### Slope and Derivatives
* The slope of a function represents how the output changes when the input changes
* Slope can be calculated as Δy / Δx, where Δy is the change in y and Δx is the change in x
* **Slope** is a measure of how the function is changing at a given point
* Calculus provides tools to examine how things are changing

### Calculating Slope with Derivatives
* Derivatives measure the rate of change of a function
* The derivative of a function is denoted as **dy/dx**, representing the ratio of how things are changing
* The power rule can be used to calculate derivatives (differentials)
* Example: **dy/dx = 2x^2 + 8x - 3** for the function y = x^3 + 4x^2 - 3x + 2
* Notations for derivatives include dy/dx, f'(x), and y'
* The derivative (slope) always points in the direction of increasing values of y

### Partial Derivatives
* When dealing with functions of multiple variables, we need to calculate partial derivatives
* A **partial derivative** captures the rate of change of a function with respect to one variable, while keeping other variables constant
* Example: Calculating partial derivatives of the Mean Squared Error (MSE) function relative to **w** and **b** in a linear function
* Partial derivatives are calculated by taking the derivative of the function with respect to one variable, while treating the other variables as constants."
"assume that every value except for the variable under analysis is a constant value. This proves to be very useful since the derivative of any constant term is ero. For example, consider the following function: 𝑦 = 𝑤𝑥2+𝑤2𝑥2+𝑏2+2 Let us imagine that we want to calculate the derivates of 𝑦relative to 𝑤and𝑏in this function. Clearly, two derivatives are required, and each of these is a partial derivative. Let’s start by calculating the partial derivative of 𝑦relative to 𝑤. Also notice that rather than using𝑑𝑦 𝑑𝑤, we now use the 𝛿or “del” character to indicate that this is a partial derivative. We will be very explicit in the following calculation so it is clear what is occurring: 𝑦 = 𝑤𝑥2+𝑤2𝑥2+𝑏2+2 𝑦 = 𝑤1𝑥2+𝑤2𝑥2+𝑤0𝑏2+2𝑤0 𝛿𝑦 𝛿𝑤= 1𝑤1−1𝑥2+2𝑤2−1𝑥2+0𝑤0−1𝑏2+02𝑤0−1 which simplifies to: 𝛿𝑦 𝛿𝑤= 𝑥2+2𝑤𝑥2 This gives us the value of𝛿𝑦 𝛿𝑤. What about the partial differential relative to 𝑏? 𝑦 = 𝑤𝑥2+𝑤2𝑥2+𝑏2+2 𝑦 = 𝑤𝑥2𝑏0+𝑤2𝑥2𝑏0+𝑏2+2𝑏0 𝛿𝑦 𝛿𝑏= 0𝑤𝑥2𝑏0−1+0𝑤2𝑥2𝑏0−1+2𝑏2−1+02𝑏0−1 which simplifies to: 𝛿𝑦 𝛿𝑏= 2𝑏 Armed with this fundamental understanding, we are ready to tackle working out the partial deriva- tives of𝑀𝑆𝐸 relative to 𝑚and𝑏if we use mean squared error as a loss function for iteratively approximating the parameters for a line that fits a set of data.

"the slope is pointing toward higher values of 𝑦, where𝑦in our case is how much loss there is. We want to move the parameters in the other direction. How much should we move them?

"The IMDB example that we just worked through is a classic problem in the Machine Learning space. While the classification of movie reviews may not seem directly applicable, there are some important lessons, and we can definitely come up with useful applications. We did just that when we translated the IMDB approach to an email classification system. This ap- proach accomplishes spam detection without writing a signature and without developing a Bayesian inference system. We could certainly reach out to a Python neural network from a tool like Zeek1, passing decoded MIME content through our network to decide if it’s junk or potentially a phishing or other scam campaign. Optimization Still, there are some really important lessons. One of the most important is that when the system is learning, which we should clearly understand to mean automatically updating coefficients to approximate a function that minimizes loss, our network does not understand the movie reviews or the emails at all! The approach to representing our data is called Bag of Words. This name derives from the fact that we are simply tracking which words are used, completely disregarding the order that the words are in2. Certainly, we could use this to create some type of word vectors as a way of preserving the order, but we’re not going to expand this particular network at this time.

"which we attempt to minimize. Gradient Descent1is one of the most common approaches used today to minimize the value of the loss function when performing deep learning. While you will find other optimization functions2with a variety of names, most of them are just different approaches to Gradient Descent. intoℝ3the resulting shape would be described as a plane. Notice thatΔ𝑦 Δ𝑥describes a scalar value. The corresponding term for the vector that describes this for a plane is the *gradient*, which is notated using ∇. In fact, any plane in ℝ𝑛 where𝑛 > 3 is termed a *hyperplane.* The gradient is the matrix that describes what would be called the slope in ℝ2. 1You will also see the term Stochastic Gradient Descent. The Stochastic portion of this name derives from randomly initializing the initial vectors. 2Optimization functions come from Calculus. In the context of neural networks, an optimization function is used to minimize the loss. 46",Book 4_2036060.pdf,47,"Here are the notes on Gradient Descent and related concepts in advanced markdown format:

**Gradient Descent**
====================

### Definition
Gradient Descent is an optimization approach used to minimize the value of the **loss function** in deep learning.

### Key Concepts
* **Gradient**: a matrix that describes the slope of a plane in ℝ𝑛 (where 𝑛 > 3).
* **Hyperplane**: a plane in ℝ𝑛 where 𝑛 > 3.
* **Scalar value**: a single value described by Δ𝑦 Δ𝑥.

### Variations
* **Stochastic Gradient Descent**: a variation of Gradient Descent that involves randomly initializing the initial vectors.
* **Other optimization functions**: different approaches to Gradient Descent, derived from Calculus, used to minimize the **loss** in **neural networks**.

### Notations
* ∇: notation for the **gradient**.
* ℝ: notation for the set of real numbers.
* ℝ𝑛: notation for ℝ raised to the power of 𝑛, where 𝑛 is a positive integer."
"This means that, at a very high level, deep learning neural networks really operate very much like linear regression. Rather than looking at fitting to a single line, however, we are passing in multidi- mensional tensors with perhaps tens of thousands of values, which represent hyperplanes. The point is that deep learning neural networks are intuitively an n-dimensional application of mul- tiple simultaneous high-order regressions being applied to the data at the same time. When you read about back-propagation, this refers to determining the current gradient of the loss function, which can be used to learn1, progressively improving the predictions. This seems a good place to point out the literal meaning of the term “Artificial Intelligence.” Really, this means “fake intelligence.” While this isn’t what people normally mean when they use this term2, whenever we can use an algorithm that appears to do something that takes intelligence, we are looking at artificial intelligence. Obviously, it’s possible for this term to be used very loosely on products! It seems appropriate to provide a more formal definition for machine learning. Machine learning is any process whereby a computer system can algorithmically improve from past experience. While the word experience does not carry the same flavor of meaning that it would for a human, this definition is very appropriate. Based on a pass through the training data attempting to map inputs to outputs, the algorithm updates the weights and biases based on their relative impact on the outputs3 and updates these values in an effort to improve in the next iteration through the data. What we’ve seen is that even a model that can make very nearly perfect predictions has no real understanding of what’s happening. This problem sits at the crux of modern research in the Machine 1Meaning, adjust the coefficients, or weight vectors, and biases. 2People usually mean computer intelligences taking over the world because they’re smarter than we are. 3The algorithm calculates the partial derivatives for the weights and biases relative to the input in order to make adjustments to these values. 47",Book 4_2036060.pdf,48,"Here are the notes in advanced bullet-point format:

We can manage these through feature engineering, but this has risks of its own.

"Activation Functions Each neuron in the neural network will have some activation function applied to the output of the neuron. The main purpose of this is to add some non-linearity into the system. This turns out to be a critical point. We understand that neural networks are examples of applied Linear Algebra. From our rudimentary introduction to Linear Algebra, we understand that it is a system of mathematics that allows us to conveniently represent and apply transformations to matrices. Further, we understand that any series of linear transformations can be represented as a single transformation matrix, regardless of how complex each transformation is. We pointed out that this is leveraged by graphics applications and neural networks all the time. Think about why this matters. What if we built a neural network with 50 hidden layers1. What if each of those layers were defined with the following function: ̂𝑌 = (𝑤⋅𝑋 +𝑏) Of course, even though we have included matrices ̂𝑌and𝑋along with a dot product between the weights and the 𝑋values, we are still looking at the formula for a line, or perhaps a set of lines. If each layer does nothing more than this , would 50 layers be able to do anything more interesting than a single layer? No! 1A hidden layer is any layer in the neural network that is not directly exposed as an input or an output. From the perspective of anything outside of the network itself, the layer and its details are hidden. 49",Book 4_2036060.pdf,50,"Here are the notes on Activation Functions in advanced bullet-point markdown format:

**Activation Functions**
======================

**Purpose**
-----------

* Add non-linearity to the neural network system

**Importance of Non-Linearity**
-----------------------------

* Without non-linearity, a neural network with multiple layers would be equivalent to a single layer
* **Linearity** means that each layer is simply applying a linear transformation to the input, which can be represented by a single transformation matrix
* 50 layers with only linear transformations would be equivalent to a single layer

**Limitations of Linear Transformations**
-------------------------------------

* Linear transformations can be represented as a single transformation matrix, regardless of complexity
* **Linear Algebra** allows for convenient representation and application of transformations to matrices
* Graphics applications and neural networks utilize this property frequently

**Need for Activation Functions**
---------------------------------

* To introduce non-linearity, allowing the neural network to learn and represent more complex relationships between inputs and outputs
* Enables the neural network to generalize and make predictions on unseen data more effectively"
"Why not? Because any series of linear operations can be collapsed into a single transformation matrix. In other words, lots of layers won’t help! This brings us back to activation functions. In the opening paragraph of this section, we stated that, “The main purpose of this is to add some non-linearity into the system.” In other words, after we calculate (𝑤⋅𝑋+𝑏) in each neuron, we need to apply some function 𝜎to it that breaks us free from a series of linear transformations. That’s it! It’s no more complex than that. The non-linearity allows us to create systems where adding multiple hidden layers allows for more interesting outputs. Sigmoid Figure 1: Sigmoid FunctionThe sigmoid function is defined as: 𝑆(𝑥) =1 1+𝑒−𝑥 As you can see in figure 1, it accepts any real value as an input and compresses the output to a value between -1 and 1. While sigmoid can be used in other ways, it is frequently used in bi- nary regression problems, especially in the out- put layer, to compress the output to some value between 0 and 1. This allows for the trivial hard boundary value of 0.5 to be applied. This func- tion is also useful if we are attempting to con- strain a regression. For example, if we are per- forming a regression and need the output to be a normalized value, the sigmoid simulates this well. Hyperbolic Tangent Figure 2: Hyperbolic Tangent FunctionHyperbolic Tangent is defined as: tanh(𝑥) =𝑒2𝑥−1 𝑒2𝑥+1 As pictured in figure 2, the Hyperbolic Tangent function maps any input value between -1 and 1. It is very similar to the sigmoid in shape, though it allows for the generation of negative values in its output. There are times when this proves useful when the normalized input data is of the same range. This function was long the darling of deep learn- ing neural networks. One reason for this was that it performs well when constraining outputs 50",Book 4_2036060.pdf,51,"Here are the notes on the topic of activation functions in neural networks, summarizing the important parts of the passage:

### Why Multiple Linear Operations Don't Help
* Any series of linear operations can be collapsed into a single transformation matrix
* Multiple layers won't help without adding non-linearity to the system

### Importance of Activation Functions
* **Add non-linearity** to the system to break free from linear transformations
* Allow for more interesting outputs when adding multiple hidden layers

### Sigmoid Function
* **Sigmoid function**: 𝑆(𝑥) = 1 / (1 + 𝑒^(-𝑥))
* Accepts any real value as input and compresses output to a value between 0 and 1
* Frequently used in binary regression problems, especially in the output layer
* Useful for constraining a regression to a normalized value

### Hyperbolic Tangent Function
* **Hyperbolic Tangent function**: tanh(𝑥) = (𝑒^(2𝑥) - 1) / (𝑒^(2𝑥) + 1)
* Maps any input value to a value between -1 and 1
* Similar to sigmoid, but allows for generation of negative values in output
* Useful when normalized input data is of the same range"
"to a continuous value between -1 and 1. The other reason is much more practical; many GPUs in the past1had built-in support for the tanh ()function. This translates to very high calculation per- formance when training the network. As you will see, this really matters as your network becomes more complex. Rectified Linear Unit Figure 3: ReLU FunctionRectified Linear Unit, or ReLU, is defined as: 𝑓(𝑥) = {𝑥if𝑥 > 0 0in all other cases A key requirement for activation functions is they must be differentiable. This means that it must be possible to calculate the derivative, which gives us the slope or the gradient of the function. ReLU isn’t differentiable because of the sharp change at 𝑥 = 0 . At this point, the slope is undefined. However, the ReLU func- tion has proven useful as an activation function in recent years. Obviously, the math is quite simple; the result is either 𝑥itself or ero. This makes it very fast. At the same time, it satisfactorily introduces non-linearity because of the behav- ior for values where 𝑥 < 0 . Yet, we said this function is not differentiable. The implementation of ReLU as an activation function is done in such a way that a sort of “fake” differential results in the derivative being defined at 𝑥 = 0 . 1This is not to say that they do not have this support anymore. Rather, we are pointing out that this support has long been provided in GPUs. 51",Book 4_2036060.pdf,52,"Here are the notes on Activation Functions in advanced Markdown format:

**Activation Functions**
========================

### Sigmoid Function
#### Definition
 Maps input to a continuous value between -1 and 1.

**Reasons for use:**

* Practical reason: many GPUs in the past had built-in support for the `tanh()` function, resulting in high calculation performance during network training.

### Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU)
#### Definition
`𝑓(𝑥) = { 𝑥 if 𝑥 > 0, 0 in all other cases`

**Key Requirements:**

* Activation functions must be **differentiable**, meaning the derivative (slope or gradient) of the function can be calculated.

**Pros and Cons:**

* **Pros:**
	+ Simple math
	+ Fast computation
	+ Introduces non-linearity for `𝑥 < 0`
* **Cons:**
	+ Not differentiable at `𝑥 = 0`, where the slope is undefined
	+ Implementation involves a ""fake"" differential to define the derivative at `𝑥 = 0`

Note: The implementation of ReLU as an activation function is done in a way that a ""fake"" differential results in the derivative being defined at `𝑥 = 0`."
"Leaky ReLU Figure 4: ReLU FunctionLeaky ReLU can be defined as: 𝑓(𝑥) = {𝑥 if𝑥 >= 0 𝑚𝑥 where𝑚is small when 𝑥 < 0 The Leaky ReLU function in figure 4is a more recent addition to the machine learning land- scape. It follows a pattern very similar to that of ReLU. For example, since it is also non- differentiable at 0, the derivative at 0is handled as a special case, allowing it to be used as an activation function. Otherwise, the main difference is that Leaky ReLU canbecome negative, albeit at a very slow rate. This still introduces a non-linearity, but it simultaneously preserves negative values. Leaky ReLU has proven useful in training networks where ReLU fails to converge well. Softmax Figure 5: Softmax FunctionSoftmax looks very complicated: 𝜎(𝑧)𝑖=𝑒𝑧𝑖 ∑𝐾 𝑗=1𝑒𝑧𝑗 For this function, the graphic visualization in figure 5might not be immediately intuitive, so let’s translate what’s happening. Softmax ex- presses the ratio of the exponentiation function applied to each value 𝑧from the input vector1 and the sum of all of the exponentials of all of the values in the input vector. Let’s try to say this more simply. Softmax takes an arbitrary length vector as input and produces an identically sized vector as output. The output vector represents the normalized ratio of each input vector. To simplify this further, it is expressing the ratio of each value within the input vector to every other element. This produces what can be viewed as a probability distribution between 0 and 1 spread across 𝑛elements in the vector. For 1Take note that the input vector here is notthe input vector to the neural network; this is the input vector to the softmax function. 52",Book 4_2036060.pdf,53,"Here are the notes on Leaky ReLU and Softmax in advanced bullet-point markdown format:

**Leaky ReLU**
=============

#### Definition
* **Leaky ReLU**: `f(x) = {x if x >= 0, mx if x < 0}`, where `m` is a small value

#### Characteristics
* Similar to ReLU, but allows negative values to pass through, albeit at a slow rate
* Introduces non-linearity while preserving negative values
* Useful in training networks where ReLU fails to converge well

**Softmax**
=============

#### Definition
* **Softmax**: `σ(z) = e^z / ∑(e^z)` (where `z` is the input vector)

#### Characteristics
* Takes an arbitrary length vector as input and produces an identically sized vector as output
* Output vector represents the normalized ratio of each input vector
* Expresses the ratio of each value within the input vector to every other element
* Produces a probability distribution between 0 and 1 spread across `n` elements in the vector"
"multi-class classification problems, it allows us to determine which of a number of options is most likely. You might wonder as to why such a seemingly complex method of finding this ratio is used. This comes back to the notion of activation functions needing to be differentiable. While other ratios can be differentiated, using Euler’s number has the enormous advantage that it is its own derivative, making the differentiation much simpler. Swish Figure 6: Swish FunctionThe Swish function is: 𝑓(𝑥) = 𝑥1 1+𝑒−𝛽𝑥 You might recognize that1 1+𝑒−𝑥is the sigmoid function. This means that Swish is just 𝑥times the result of the sigmoid function. How is this useful? One of the weaknesses of the ReLU function is that for all values 𝑥 <= 0 , the slope is ero. This static slope of ero can lead to issues when training, resulting in the model failing to con- verge on a solution. One approach to address- ing this is found above: Leaky ReLU. Swish is another attempt to solve this problem. You can see that for values where 𝑥 > 0 , swish behaves very much the same way that ReLU and Leaky ReLU do. However, it has some advantages. First, it is naturally differentiable at ero, not requiring any special hackery since it is a continuous function. Second, unlike both ReLU and Leaky ReLU, the slope for values where 𝑥 <= 0 , the slope is no longer a static value. 53",Book 4_2036060.pdf,54,"**Multi-Class Classification and Activation Functions**
======================================================

### Importance of Differentiable Activation Functions

* In multi-class classification problems, we need to determine which of multiple options is most likely
* **Differentiable activation functions** are required to simplify the differentiation process
* Using Euler's number (e) has the advantage of being its own derivative, making differentiation simpler

### Swish Activation Function

* **Swish function**: `f(x) = x / (1 + e^(-βx))`
* Similar to the **sigmoid function**, but multiplied by `x`
* **Advantages**:
	+ **Differentiable at zero**, unlike ReLU and Leaky ReLU
	+ **Non-static slope** for `x <= 0`, unlike ReLU and Leaky ReLU
* **Similar behavior** to ReLU and Leaky ReLU for `x > 0`

### Limitations of ReLU and Leaky ReLU

* **ReLU**:
	+ Slope is zero for `x <= 0`, leading to issues during training
	+ Model may fail to converge on a solution
* **Leaky ReLU**:
	+ Attempts to address ReLU's limitations, but still has a static slope for `x <= 0`"
"Exponential Figure 7: Exponential FunctionThe exponential function is: 𝑓(𝑥) = 𝑒𝑥 For situations where it is desirable to transform the output of neurons to a positive value that has a continuously changing slope, the exponential function in figure 7is perfect. Unlike ReLU and its kin, we have a continuously changing slope. Unlike sigmoid and Hyperbolic Tangent, the value can increase without bound, which can be desirable when predicting some contin- uous real value. There are many more activation functions than what we have defined here. These are just the most commonly used functions. TensorFlow has additional activation functions and research papers are published constantly that experiment with new functions. If you desire, or have the need, you can define your own activation functions. Ten- sorFlow makes this possible by exposing an activations class from which you can inherit. We will not create any custom activation functions in this class. We will, however, look at how you can create your own loss functions, which follow a very similar pattern. 54",Book 4_2036060.pdf,55,"Here are the notes on Exponential Function in advanced bullet-point markdown format:

"We want to see a way that we can directly translate what we’ve done so far to information-security- related activities. We will do this by applying our skills to some network-related problems. We are going to try to develop a proof-of-concept model that can tell the difference between IP packets and packets that are not IP. While this is a trivial problem, it has the potential to sit at the foundation of a much more complex model. For example, what if we had a model that could not only tell IP from not IP, but it could distinguish common transport layer protocols? What if we took that even further and had models that were able to determine if something that was TCP and appeared to be HTTP because of the port that it is on actually behaves like HTTP? Now that would be useful! We won’t go quite that far right now. However, we will come very close before the end of this volume. We will absolutely be covering everything that you need to know to be able to build a set of models that can do precisely this! 55",Book 4_2036060.pdf,56,"Here are the notes in advanced bullet-point format:

### Filtering Non-IP Packets
* **Objective**: Identify and explore non-IP packets in a network capture.
* **Tool**: Wireshark, a network protocol analyzer.

	+ Open Wireshark and load a capture file.
	+ Apply a filter to display only non-IP packets.

	+ Explore the **frame**, **eth**, and **llc** protocols in the non-IP packets.

### Understanding Non-IP Packets
* **Non-IP packets**: Packets that do not carry IP protocol information.
* **Examples**: ARP (Address Resolution Protocol), VLAN (Virtual Local Area Network), and PPP (Point-to-Point Protocol) packets.

### Capturing Non-IP Packets
* **Wireshark Capture Filter**: `not port 27444` (excluding IP packets)
* **Wireshark Display Filter**: `not ip` (displaying only non-IP packets)

### Analyzing Non-IP Packets
* **Frame**: The basic unit of data transmission in a network.
* **Ethernet (eth)**: A local area network technology.
* **Logical Link Control (LLC)**: A protocol that manages the flow of data between devices.
* **Packet analysis**: Examining packet contents to understand network communication.

"Let’s think this over. What we’ve built isn’t really that smart, but it’s still important. You and I can look at these packets and very readily decide which protocol they are. We also have tools that can be directed to select packets based on the protocol in use. But in this case, our model is able to tell the difference between protocols without us ever defining where the protocol header values are or what they mean! That’s huge! There are definitely things that can go wrong. As we have seen, one of the critical parts of Machine Learning is figuring out what the features should be. For example, if we provide our network with features that include MAC addresses, the model could easily develop false correlations that have nothing to do with the protocol in use! This could mean that we’ve selected our features poorly, but it could also mean that our training data is insufficient! Generally, the more training data you can provide, the better. That training data needs to be representative of real-world conditions. If we were creating a model that is intended to generally predict protocols on any network, we would either need to reject the addresses as features (since every network will be different) or include training data that adequately covers all of the addresses likely to be seen in the real world! It’s also important that our training data is well balanced. This means that we don’t want it skewed toward any particular outcome. If we are training a neural network for binary classification, we really want a 50/50 mix in our training data. 57",Book 4_2036060.pdf,58,"Here are the notes in advanced bullet-point format:

"Monitoring Experiments Up until this point, we have only used the console output (in Jupyter) during training and our own plotting function to examine how our model is training and performing overall. Are there ways to monitor the training visually while the model is training? Are there other visual tools that are useful for examining aspects of the model to determine how well training is going? Yes! Let’s briefly examine two wonderful tools that fill this important role. 58",Book 4_2036060.pdf,59,"Here are the notes in advanced bullet-point markdown format:

"TensorBoard TensorBoard can be considered an integrated tool for monitoring TensorFlow experiments even though it is within a separate Python package. When you install TensorFlow, the matching Tensor- Board version is installed at the same time. Using TensorBoard requires a few steps. First, you must instantiate a TensorBoard callback from Keras. A callback function is a function that you define to handle some specific event. Rather than calling this kind of function directly, you usually pass a function pointer to it to a library function that will then call your function when a certain event occurs. In this case, we are creating a callback object that will be called automatically when certain events happen during training, such as the start of a batch, end of a batch, start of an epoch, end of an epoch, and others. You don’t need to worry too much about these details since the only thing you really need to do is configure the callback as you desire. You can configure the object by passing a list of keyword parameters to the class initializer as you instantiate it. At a minimum, you must pass the log_dir parameter, which should be configured to point at the directory where logs should be created. When you define this name, it is a very good idea to use some kind of dynamic name. For example, you might define it like this: current_time = datetime.datetime.now().strftime(""%Y%m%d-%H%M%S"") tensorboard = tf.keras.callbacks.TensorBoard( log_dir = f'logs/t1/{current_time}' ) In this case, we have configured the callback to store its logs in a directory named logs relative to where this notebook is running. Within that directory, a subdirectory named t1should be created. Usually this would be the name of your model, but could be anything. Finally, we are dynamically 59",Book 4_2036060.pdf,60,"Here are the notes on TensorBoard in advanced bullet-point format:

**What is TensorBoard?**

		+ A callback function is a function that handles specific events
		+ Pass a function pointer to a library function, which calls your function when an event occurs
	2. **Configure the callback object**

* A subdirectory named `t1` is created within the log directory (e.g., the name of the model)"
"using the current date and time when the code is executed to create yet another sub directory. The reason that this is important is that every time you run a fit, it will append to the logs according to the configuration of the callback. This can lead to very difficult to read logs. By defining this value dynamically and including this definition in the same cell where we define our model or call our fit function, each fit() call will have its own collection of logs. This will make it easy to tell one run from another in the TensorBoard interface. Once this has been defined, we need simply pass this tensorboard object as a list member to thecallbacks keyword argument in our call to fit() . 60",Book 4_2036060.pdf,61,"Here are the notes on the topic of using TensorBoard with dynamic logging directories:

**TensorBoard Logging with Dynamic Directories**
=============================================

### Importance of Dynamic Logging Directories
* To avoid appended logs that are difficult to read
* Each fit() call should have its own collection of logs for easy distinction in TensorBoard interface

### Creating Dynamic Logging Directories
* Use current date and time to create a new subdirectory for each fit() call
* Define the logging directory dynamically in the same cell where the model is defined or the fit function is called

### Implementing Dynamic Logging
* Create a TensorBoard object with the dynamic logging directory
* Pass the TensorBoard object as a list member to the `callbacks` keyword argument in the fit() function call

### Benefits
* Easy to distinguish between different fit() calls in the TensorBoard interface
* Organized and readable logs for each fit() call"
"Assuming you have defined a TensorBoard callback, you can start the TensorBoard server to view the logs in a web browser. To start TensorBoard, you should navigate (at the command line) to the directory where the logs directory exists. Once you have done so, you can execute the following command: tensorboard --logdir=./logs --bind_all There are many other arguments available, and the bind-all is not strictly required. You must include the logdir parameter, however. Notice that there is an inconsistency in that the callback is defined using log_dir but the command line argument is logdir . Thebind-all parameter tells TensorBoard to begin serving the logs on all interfaces on the host where TensorBoard is running. This is convenient if you are running your experiment on a remote system and want to track the TensorBoard output from your desktop. As an added bit of advice, it is possible to start TensorBoard from within Jupyter and have it em- bedded into a Jupyter cell. We strongly discourage you from doing this. In fact, we discourage it so strongly, we won’t even show you how to do it. Why, though, is this such a bad idea? If you start TensorBoard in this way, your TensorBoard process is now a child of Jupyter. This doesn’t seem like such a bad thing, but a consequence is that when you shut down Jupyter, the TensorBoard process becomes detached. To shut it down, you must now track it down in the Process Explorer (on Windows) or through the process list (on other operating systems). Worse, if you rerun the cell where you started TensorBoard, it will start another TensorBoard instance; you now have two copies running. If you restart and run all cells, you will have yet another copy running! Another reason this isn’t ideal is that while it at first seems “cool” to have it in a cell, you will quickly realize that it’s very inconvenient to continually have to scroll back to the TensorBoard cell to see what’s happening. If we connect to it directly in another tab or browser window, it is much easier 61",Book 4_2036060.pdf,62,"Here are the notes in advanced bullet-point markdown format:

"TensorBoard provides a number of different views of our model and of its training progress. We are not going to dig into these. However, it is worth looking at the Histogram view to see an example of the kind of thing you might look for when training a model. As a model trains, we are hoping that the model will converge on a solution. The concept comes from mathematics where an iterative function can be said to either converge ordiverge . That is, does the function tend to converge on some limit (or value), or does the function tend to diverge. Diverge would mean that the value isn’t heading anywhere in particular, or perhaps is headed toward positive or negative infinity. As our model trains, we are hoping that the model will converge on a set of weights and biases that tends to solve our problem to a reasonable degree. Look carefully at the histograms pictured in the image above. We are here looking at the bias values for a model that is attempting to find the coordinates of a bounding box for something within an image. Notice that the values start out with some general movement, but after a few epochs we can see that they are clearly developing in definite directions. What would it look like if the network were not converging? On the one hand we might see the values moving back and forth from side to side. This would tend to indicate that the learning rate is too high and that the optimizer is having a hard time settling into a minimal loss. On the other hand, if the histogram looks more like random ripples on the water, it likely indicates that the network is not converging at all. This makes sense since the ripples would tend to look like random behavior. 63",Book 4_2036060.pdf,64,"Here are the notes on TensorBoard and model convergence:

**TensorBoard**
* Provides multiple views of a model and its training progress
* **Histogram view** is particularly useful for monitoring model convergence

**Model Convergence**
* The process by which a model's parameters (weights and biases) settle on a stable solution
* Analogous to mathematical concept of **convergence** vs. **divergence**
	+ **Convergence**: iterative function tends towards a limit (or value)
	+ **Divergence**: iterative function does not tend towards a limit (e.g., heads towards infinity)

**Monitoring Convergence in TensorBoard**
* **Histogram view** helps visualize bias values during training
* **Converging model**:
	+ Bias values move in a definite direction over time
	+ Model settles on a set of weights and biases that solve the problem reasonably well
* **Non-converging model**:
	+ Bias values move back and forth or exhibit random behavior
	+ May indicate:
		- **Learning rate is too high**: optimizer has trouble settling on minimal loss
		- **Model is not converging**: random, unstable behavior"
"Weights and Biases Weights and Biases is a commercial service and library available from wandb.ai . I usually do not write about commercial solutions, especially when there is a free solution available, so as not to seem biased toward one vendor or another. However, I find Weights and Biases so much easier to use than TensorBoard that I feel compelled to mention it in this course. Weights and Biases provides up to 100 GB of storage for logs and other model artifacts if you choose to set up a personal account. This personal account is absolutely free. It allows you to view most any type of information about your model in a very consistent interface. If you have a need to use this in your business, you can subscribe to plans in which you pay a small amount based on the amount of storage you require. You can additionally subscribe as a business and pay per seat. For example, $50 per month per team member would buy you a 10-person team where all of the data and model management can be shared amongst team members. If you have a larger team, you are well advised to contact their sales team directly since the cost per seat tends to go down. Creating an account can be done with either a standalone account (traditional username/password arrangement) or by linking to your GitHub or Google ID. Once you have created an account and executed pip install wandb , you are just about ready to go. After installing wandb , you need to execute wandb login from the command line. You will be prompted to authenticate using the account you have linked to or created for wandb.ai.

The second icon in the interface gives you a view of the various training behaviors for the model you are training. There are many more views available depending on the kind of model you are training or the types of layers within that model. You also have access to some wonderful views that allow you to compare similar models. The ability to compare different training runs for similar models can be very helpful when trying to understand why a model is or is not converging. It can also be very useful when trying to optimize a model manually. We will examine another technique for automatically optimizing models as the last topic in our course. 67,Book 4_2036060.pdf,68,"Here are the notes on the provided passage:

"Categorization Problems To dig into this more deeply, we need to be able to develop networks that can classify things into more than two categories. We will address this problem in this section. 68",Book 4_2036060.pdf,69,"Here are the notes on Categorization Problems in advanced markdown format:

**Categorization Problems**
==========================

### Overview

* **Multi-class classification**: ability to classify into more than two categories
* Importance of developing networks that can handle this type of problem

### Problem Statement

* **Binary classification** (two categories) is not sufficient
* Need to address categorization into **multiple classes**

### Goal

* Develop networks that can classify into more than two categories
* Overcome the limitations of binary classification"
"When we perform a binary classification, a classification that has two possible outcomes, it feels very natural to use a hard decision boundary that examines the result of a sigmoid function applied to the final output layer. We can view that sigmoid as producing a probability or likelihood value. The closer to 1 or 0, the stronger the likelihood of that classification. This approach is also known as a logistic regression. Thelogistic portion of this comes from the notion that we are coming up with a binary solution, a yes or no, a logical positive or negative. If you think about it, we could form vastly more complex networks using logistic regression if we were to nest them together like Decision Trees. Each level in the tree would be performing a single binary classification as to whether something is or isn’t so. If it isn’t, then it is passed down to another logistic regression that follows. This does seem like a clumsy solution, however. A far more elegant solution would be to develop a technique that allows us to put our inputs into categories. We can do this with Decision Trees. Support Vector Machines are also capable of doing this. Can we do this same thing with neural networks? Yes! 69",Book 4_2036060.pdf,70,"Here are the notes in advanced markdown format:
**Binary Classification and Logistic Regression**
=====================================================

**What is Binary Classification?**
------------------------------------

* A classification with two possible outcomes (e.g., yes/no, positive/negative)
* Can be achieved using a sigmoid function applied to the final output layer
* Produces a probability or likelihood value between 0 and 1
* Closer to 1 or 0 indicates stronger likelihood of classification

**Logistic Regression**
----------------------

* Also known as logistic regression
* **Logistic** refers to coming up with a binary solution (yes/no, positive/negative)
* Can be used to form complex networks by nesting logistic regression models

**Limitations of Nested Logistic Regression**
------------------------------------------

* Can be a clumsy solution
* Leads to complex decision trees with multiple binary classifications

**Alternative Solutions**
---------------------------

* **Decision Trees**: can categorize inputs into categories
* **Support Vector Machines**: can also categorize inputs into categories
* **Neural Networks**: can also be used for categorization (more elegant solution)

"We can define any number of output neurons in our network. What if we were to define one neuron for each possible output class? While many useful problems can be solved with logistic regression, there are many more problems that cannot. If you consider the traditional computer vision problem of distinguishing cats from dogs, we are fac- ing a logistic regression. Just how dog-like or cat-like is an image? We can represent this outcome with a single neuron where 0 means one thing and 1 means another. This approach still produces a continuous value, though it is bounded between 0 and 1. It indicates the dogginess or cattiness of whatever we input to the network. What if we want to solve a more interesting problem? What if we want a network that doesn’t just identify dogs, it identifies the kind of dog? This is no longer well-suited to logistic regression because a dog cannot be a Husky and a Poodle and a Pomeranian and an Irish setter and a Dachshund all at once1. What we really have are a bunch of possible bins into which we can classify our sample dog. We can think of the problem as accumulating evidence, adding to each of the possible breed-bins, until we determine which bin is most likely. If you think about the activation function that makes the most sense for this, you should think of softmax. That would be the perfect activation for the output layer since it tells us which of the neurons is predominantly activated. 1To be fair, a dog could be a mutt and be comprised of all of those things, but we are nowhere near a computer vision solution that can tell which breeds are in the ancestry of a particular dog! 70",Book 4_2036060.pdf,71,"**Output Neurons and Logistic Regression**
===========================================

* **Definition:** Output neurons can be defined to represent each possible output class.
* **Limitations of Logistic Regression:**
	+ Logistic regression is suitable for binary classification problems (e.g., cat vs. dog).
	+ However, it's not effective for multi-class classification problems (e.g., identifying dog breeds).
* **Example: Dog Breed Classification**
	+ We want to identify the specific breed of dog (e.g., Husky, Poodle, Pomeranian, etc.).
	+ Logistic regression is not suitable for this problem because a dog can only be one breed at a time.
* **Accumulating Evidence and Softmax**
	+ We can think of the problem as accumulating evidence and adding to each of the possible breed-bins.
	+ **Softmax** is the perfect activation function for the output layer, as it tells us which neuron is predominantly activated.
* **Key Concept:** Softmax is used in multi-class classification problems to output a probability distribution over all classes."
"Cross-Entropy Loss In all of the neural network cases that we have considered so far, we have used Mean Squared Error as our loss function. This makes sense since we are attempting to perform a regression, and a Mean Squared Error can be used to approximate the distance from the correct value. Mean squared error is also known as 𝐿2loss. Figure 8: Binary Cross-Entropy LossA much more common form of loss is binary cross-entropy loss orlog loss . We can define the binary cross-entropy loss for a single prediction with the following function: −(𝑦 log(𝑝)+(1−𝑦) log(1−𝑝) If we sweep the value 𝑝, which represents ̂ 𝑦or the predicted probability regression and assume that ground truth is 𝑦 = 1 , we end up with the graph in figure 8. What if ground truth 𝑦 = 0 ? Then the graph is mirrored from left to right around𝑥 = 0.5 . This function provides a con- tinuous value that measures loss. The further away we are from the correct value for ̂ 𝑦, the more quickly the loss grows. As we approach the correct prediction, the loss slowly shrinks to ero. Since we are now expanding into categorical problems, we need a loss function that works well with multiple categories. Categorical Cross-entropy Loss satisfies this requirement: 71",Book 4_2036060.pdf,72,"**Loss Functions in Neural Networks**
=====================================

### Mean Squared Error (MSE) / 𝐿2 Loss
* Used for regression tasks
* Measures distance from correct value
* Also known as 𝐿2 loss

### Binary Cross-Entropy Loss (Log Loss)
* Used for binary classification tasks
* Defined as: −(𝑦 log(𝑝) + (1 − 𝑦) log(1 − 𝑝))
* Measures the difference between predicted probability (̂ 𝑦) and ground truth (𝑦)
* Graph:
	+ When 𝑦 = 1, the graph is as shown in Figure 8
	+ When 𝑦 = 0, the graph is mirrored around 𝑥 = 0.5
* Loss grows rapidly as prediction moves away from correct value
* Loss shrinks to zero as prediction approaches correct value

### Categorical Cross-Entropy Loss
* Used for multi-class classification tasks
* Extends binary cross-entropy loss to handle multiple categories"
"𝐶𝐸 = −𝐾 ∑ 𝑖𝑡𝑖log(𝑒𝑧𝑖 ∑𝐾 𝑗=1𝑒𝑧𝑗) Yikes! That might be the scariest function we’ve seen so far. Look at it again. Specifically, look at what’s inside of the log ()term. That should look familiar. If you’re not sure where you’ve seen that before, we’ll give you a hint. That’s one of our activation functions. You could turn back to find it, but you really don’t need to. Was there an activation function that is specifically designed for use with multiclass problems? An activation function that allows us to determine which among any number of neurons is most activated overall? Yes! softmax. To simplify this, the categorical cross-entropy loss is calculated as the sum of all of the logarithms of all of the softmax activations for the predictions. That seems like a mouthful, but it’s really not so bad. If we want to determine the loss for one specific prediction in a categorical problem, we can simply take the logarithm of the softmax and multiply it by −𝑡𝑖where𝑡𝑖is the ground-truth value. 72",Book 4_2036060.pdf,73,"Here are the notes on the categorical cross-entropy loss function:

**Categorical Cross-Entropy Loss Function**

* **CE = −K \* ∑[i=1](itilog(ezi / ∑[j=1]K eej))**
* The function may look complex, but it's based on a familiar concept:
	+ The logarithmic term is reminiscent of an activation function
	+ Specifically, it's related to **softmax**, designed for multiclass problems
* **Simplification**:
	+ Categorical cross-entropy loss is the sum of logarithms of softmax activations for predictions
	+ To calculate loss for a single prediction:
		- Take the logarithm of the softmax activation
		- Multiply by −𝑡𝑖 (ground-truth value)"
"Sigmoid vs. Softmax As we venture further into this multiclass classification landscape, it should be apparent to you that the sigmoid function cannot be the correct activation to apply. Instead, it must be softmax since it allows us to mathematically distinguish which neuron is activated. What softmax is doing, in essence, is creating a single probability distribution across 𝑛output neurons. The output vector from softmax can be viewed as a vector of probabilities, each indicating the likelihood that the input data maps to a particular category. 73",Book 4_2036060.pdf,74,"**Sigmoid vs. Softmax**
=======================

### Key Concepts

* **Sigmoid function**: not suitable for multiclass classification
* **Softmax function**: used for multiclass classification

### Why Softmax?

* Allows mathematical distinction of which neuron is activated
* Creates a single probability distribution across **n** output neurons
* Output vector from softmax represents a vector of probabilities
* Each probability indicates the likelihood of input data mapping to a particular category"
"One of the things that we have implied that we would discuss is how to use supervised learning to identify anomalies. The trick to this isn’t very difficult, but unless you understand what is happening in the loss and activation functions, figuring it out might not be intuitive. Since all supervised learning methods require us to tell the system how many different categories there are and to provide training samples for each category, we should have a dawning realization that is related to the classification of anomalies: We need some way to classify something as a thing that our network has no idea how to classify. One way to approach this problem is to feed one model from another model. For example, perhaps we create a decision tree that first asks, “Is this something that we have seen before?” If the answer is yes, it can then be fed to a neural network that tries to classify the system. If the answer is no, it’s time for human intervention and more training. Another related possibility is an unsupervised approach. Remember that the difference between supervised and unsupervised is whether or not we provide labeled data for training. One of the approaches for this that seems most appropriate is Stochastic Outlier Selection, which goes back to at least the 1990s. Unfortunately, this requires massive amounts of data, which is why most systems will require that you allow them to learn about your network for a month or more. We also continue to be confronted with the problem of inadvertently having malicious or anomalous behaviors in our training data, throwing off our modeling. Could we accomplish something similar using far less data? Maybe. What if we created a model that could classify data into known protocol classifications? This is a tractable problem, and we might be able to leverage it to find the unusual! 74",Book 4_2036060.pdf,75,"Here are the notes on using supervised learning to identify anomalies:

=============================================

### Origins
* Originally proposed as a general solution to computer vision problems
* Revolutionized computer vision, moving away from edge and color detection

### Pre-CNN Computer Vision (1980s-1990s)
* Focused on edge and color detection to identify shapes
* Difficult to write code for and never highly successful for non-trivial problems

### Convolutional Approaches in Computer Graphics
* Used in computer graphics for decades (since 1980s)
* Involved mathematical filters processed as convolutions
* Allowed for image sharpening, softening, blurring, and post-processing

### CNNs vs. Traditional Convolutional Approaches
* Run in reverse: allow the computer to algorithmically determine the convolution matrix
* Instead of defining a convolution matrix, the CNN finds the best features in an image

### Applications of CNNs
* **Computer Vision**: image recognition, object detection, image classification
* **Audio Analysis**: analyzing audio data, useful for time-series tasks

### Advantages of CNNs
* **Computationally Efficient**: take advantage of highly parallelizable mathematics
* **Faster than LSTM and RNN Networks**: more efficient than traditional recurrent neural networks"
"Convolving So, then, what is a convolution, and what is a convolutional network. To explain this, let’s use a very simple example. Let’s use a single image that is 25 × 25pixels. The image is a gray-scale image. Since the image is gray scale, each pixel can be represented by a single byte. Each byte representssomegrayvaluefrom0,black,to255,white.

=====================================

### What is a Convolution?

* A convolution is a process of applying a series of filters (kernels) to an image to extract features.
* In a simple example, a 25 × 25 pixel grayscale image is used, where each pixel is represented by a single byte (0-255).

### Convolving an Image
------------------------

* Create a series of 3 × 3 filters (kernels) to process the image.
* Each filter is applied to the image bytes in the following manner:
	+ First pass: Apply the first filter to the top-left corner of the image.
	+ Move the filter to the right by one position and apply it to the adjacent bytes.
	+ Continue moving the filter to the right until it reaches the right edge of the image.
	+ Slide the filter down one position and repeat the process from the left edge of the image.

### Important Terms

**Convolutional Operations**
====================================

**Valid Convolutions**
------------------------

* Performing a valid convolution means there is no padding (default)
* Formula to determine output matrix size: 𝑋𝑚×𝑛 ⋆ 𝐹𝑖×𝑖 = 𝑌(𝑚−𝑖+1)×(𝑛−𝑖+1)
* Example: 25 × 25 image convolved with 3 × 3 filter results in 23 × 23 output matrix
* **Reduced output matrix size**

**Stride Effect**
-----------------

* Increasing stride reduces output matrix size further
* May result in matrix diminishing to a scalar (undesirable)

**Same Convolutions**
---------------------

* Output matrix size remains the same as input matrix size
* **Padding** is used to achieve this
* Different padding techniques are available
* **Less meaningful data** along edges compared to data in the center

=====================================================================================

**Training Process**
-------------------

* Similar to dense neural networks, but adjust kernel cell values instead of weights and biases.

* Typically start with a small number of filters and add more in subsequent layers.
* Reasoning: initial layers identify broad features, while later layers identify more abstract features.

**Convolution Layers**
---------------------

* Apply valid convolutions, resulting in smaller input matrices.
* Each kernel produces its own output matrix (Figure 2).
* Dimensions of individual matrices decrease, but more matrices are produced.

"Kernels In the past, researchers would spend time tinkering with handmade kernels, or filters, to create matrices that could do things like sharpen the edges of an image. Kernels to accomplish various tasks are well known and documented. They operate by emphasizing aspects of adjacent pixels duringtheconvolution.

**Kernels**
================

### Definition
**Kernels** (or filters) are matrices used in image processing to perform various tasks, such as sharpening image edges.

### How Kernels Work
* Operate by emphasizing aspects of adjacent pixels during convolution.
* A kernel **emphasizes** the center pixel with a higher value, while **de-emphasizing** surrounding pixels.

### Example of a Sharpening Filter
```markdown
⎡⎢ ⎣
  0 -1  0
 -1  5 -1
  0 -1  0
⎤⎥ ⎦
```
* This filter **sharpenes image data** by:
	+ Emphasizing the center pixel with 5 times its value.
	+ De-emphasizing diagonal pixels (0).
	+ De-emphasizing vertical and horizontal neighbors (-1).

### Key Difference in Machine Learning
* Instead of using **predefined kernels**, machine learning allows the algorithm to determine good filter values on its own.
* Convolutional neural networks can find filters that emphasize various **interesting features**, even if they don't make sense to humans."

=============================

### Reasons for Suboptimal Network Performance
------------------------------------------------

* **Suboptimal input data representation**: The way input data is represented might not be suitable for the network.
* **Network design flaws**: The number of layers, neurons, filters, and activations might not be optimal for the problem.
* **Problem complexity**: The problem itself might be too complex for the network to solve.

* **Probabilistic modeling** (previous approaches): Modeled conditional probability space.
* **Semantic modeling** (current approach): Uses convolutional layers to analyze relationships between words.

### Challenges in Differentiating Ham and Spam
------------------------------------------------

* **Semantic similarity**: Ham and spam have valid semantic meanings, making it difficult for the CNN to discern differences.
* **Local relationships**: The CNN focuses on relationships between nearby words, which might not be sufficient to differentiate between ham and spam.

**Confusion Matrices, Precision, Recall, and Specificity**
======================================================

**Pitfalls of Focusing on Accuracy**
------------------------------------

* When working with machine learning and making predictions, it's common to focus on **accuracy** as the most important measurement of a model.
* However, it's essential to consider other tools to examine how well a model performs.

**Confusion Matrices**
---------------------

* A **confusion matrix** is a valuable tool to evaluate model performance, especially in multi-class problems or models that generate more than one output.
* A confusion matrix helps identify which categories are being confused for which other categories.

**Example: Multi-Class Classification**
-------------------------------------

* Imagine a model that performs multi-class classification, classifying input data into 10 different categories.
* After training, the network has an **accuracy** of 50%.
* While this may seem poor, it's better than a **random guess** which would result in an accuracy of 10%.
* However, the model is still not useful, and a confusion matrix can help identify areas for improvement.

**Benefits of Confusion Matrices**
---------------------------------

* A confusion matrix can help identify:
	+ Which categories need additional work in the training data.
	+ Categories that are similar and may need to be collapsed into a single category.
	+ Features that can better distinguish between categories."

===============

### Definition
The bottleneck layer in a neural network, comprising the **Latent Dimensions**, is referred to as the Latent Space.

### Characteristics
* Compressed representation of high-dimensional data, resulting in loss of some detail
* Similar to Principle Component Analysis (PCA), but the network learns the representation instead of calculating eigenvectors and eigenvalues
* Solution arrived at by the network is usually very close to the eigenvectors that would solve the problem as a simple matrix

### Components
* **Encoder**: responsible for compressing high-dimensional data into a lower-dimensional representation (latent space)
* **Decoder**: proceeds from the bottleneck to the output, reconstructing the original data from the latent space

### Training an Autoencoder
* Trained differently compared to other networks
* Instead of transforming inputs, 𝑋, to outputs, 𝑌, an autoencoder is trained to transform 𝑋 to 𝑋 (reconstructing the original data from the latent space)

* **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: a measure of the average magnitude of the errors in a set of predictions, without considering their directions.

### Formula
* **MAE Formula**: `1/n * ∑|y_i - y|` where `y_i` is the predicted value and `y` is the actual value.

### Benefits
* Does not suffer from **numeric instability** when the loss is very small.

### Drawbacks
* Lacks the benefits of **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**, such as a derivative that helps in optimization.
* The derivative of MAE is a **constant value** of 1 or -1, depending on which side of the solution the estimate is currently on."

**Huber Loss Function**
=====================

### Definition

The Huber Loss Function is a combination of the **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** and **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)** loss functions.

### Formula

𝐿𝛿(𝑎) = 
* {1/2𝑎² for |𝑎| ≤ 𝛿
* 𝛿(|𝑎| - 1/2𝛿), otherwise

### Characteristics

* When |𝑎| is larger relative to 𝛿, the loss will be **linear**.
* When |𝑎| is small relative to 𝛿, the function will use the characteristics of **squared error loss**.

### Use Cases

* Use the Huber Loss Function when:
	+ The loss is exploding or becoming very large very quickly, preventing the network from converging."

**Overview**
------------

* A type of autoencoder used for generative modeling
* Can be used to create rudimentary Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)

**Key Components**
-------------------

* **Latent Space**: has two dimensions

**Using the Trained Network**
---------------------------

* Remove the encoder after training
* Use the latent space as a set of ""tuning knobs"" to generate new data points
* Select points from the modeled distributions to generate new outputs

"We’ve now solved the Ham vs. Spam problem in several different ways. We keep returning to this problem because in the information security space, there are many ways that this type of language processing is useful. Consider some examples: •Attempting to attach attribution to an email or internet posting. •Categorizing or prioritizing incoming helpdesk or security tickets. •Identifying potentially malicious email. •Identifying potentially malicious attachments.

Our primary interface with customers, suppliers, vendors, and others is via web interfaces and ser- vices. When our organization is operating at scale, we will no doubt be providing some interface for self-service account creation, password resets, and more. One of the primary ways that we defend these interfaces from abuse is through the use of CAPTCHAs1. Solving CAPTCHAs Since humans often find CAPTCHAs so difficult to solve, developers and executives often believe that they provide strong protection against automated attacks. This turns out not to be true. What we’d like to do is build a proof of concept CAPTCHA system and then attempt to build a neural network that can solve that CAPTCHA.

"In the end, our finished CAPTCHA will have multiple symbols scattered in random locations in an image. The symbols will be rendered at random sizes and use random fonts. Building such a CAPTCHA isn’t difficult, but we will begin much more simply. The reason for initial simplicity is that, at this point, we are only hypothesizing that we can use a neural network to solve such a CAPTCHA. Rather than building a very complex CAPTCHA first and then struggling to solve it, we will begin by generating a very simple CATPCHA, prove that we can solve that, and then take the lessons that we learn from that solution to solve the full CAPTCHA.

"Think about what our network must do. For the finished CAPTCHA, it must first find the bounding boxes in which each character appears. Next, it has to identify each discrete character found within a bounding box correctly. Figure 1: Bicycles CAPTCHAIt turns out that this problem is more difficult for a computer to solve than many of the other CAPTCHAs currently being used. For exam- ple, consider the CAPTCHA in figure 1. You have no doubt encountered something similar, where you are presented with a grid of images and must find fire hydrants, street signs, people, etc. At first glance, this appears to be a very difficult problem! For a human, it can be very challeng- ing at times. However, think about this from a computer vision perspective compared to our current CAPTCHA. Doesn’t this CAPTCHA tell us where the bounding boxes are? Since this is the case, we need simply train our net- work to identify bicycles, for example, and then pass each of the nine images within the bound- ing box into our network to perform a logistic regression. That’s simple! Other CAPTCHAs can be more challenging, but still aren’t too bad. They are related to the 8",Book 6_2036060.pdf,9,"Here are the notes on the topic of CAPTCHAs and computer vision:

"problem we are solving right now. Figure 2is an example of just such a CAPTCHA. At first, this might seem more difficult, but it isn’t. The user is being asked to click on all of the 16 regions that contain traffic lights. This gives us two potential approaches to solving this problem. Figure 2: Traffic Lights CAPTCHAThe first might be to merge all 16 images into a single image and to then perform a regres- sion that attempts to locate the bounding boxes where traffic lights appear. You might not be certain how to do this just now, but that is pre- cisely what we are about to do with characters; this is the same problem. Once we identify the bounding boxes, it is trivial to look back at the original 16 source images and determine which images contain traffic lights. Another approach to solving this might be to treat each image as a discrete image. We can now apply the same traffic light regression net- work to each of these 16 smaller images, identi- fying which ones contain traffic lights. In practice, the first approach tends to be more accurate, but there is a problem; we need to have some idea how many traffic lights we ex- pect to find so that we can properly define our bounding boxes. For this reason, a reasonable solution takes a slightly different approach: 1.Merge the 16 images into a single image. 2.Beginning in the top-left corner, process some 𝑚 × 𝑛 region with our neural net- work looking for traffic lights. 3.Slide the window to the right, just as we would in a convolution. In other words, we are applying a convolutional approach that then applies a convolutional network to each window that makes up the overall image. When we finish this, we should have a good idea as to how many traffic lights there are and, with some post-processing, be able to determine the approximate locations of those traffic lights in the images. 9",Book 6_2036060.pdf,10,"**CAPTCHA Problem: Traffic Lights**

"This notion of finding bounding boxes means that we need something other than a logistic regression. Recall that a logistic regression will return some continuous value in the range from 0 through 1. Even when we perform a categorization problem with multiple categories, we are still producing what amounts to a logistic regression; we are just performing that regression across multiple neurons simultaneously. For the current problem, we need to come up with a real valued result that represents coordinates of the bounding boxes. It turns out that this isn’t difficult to do. It also turns out to be true that it doesn’t matter if the coordinates that the network finds represent the upper-left and lower-right corners or one of the corners with an associated width and height from that corner. Both problems are solved in the same way. There is, however, something bigger at work. Neural networks can be used to find a system of neurons that can approximate any continuous function. This is quite an interesting idea. Time permitting, your instructor will demonstrate this at some point during the next lab. 10",Book 6_2036060.pdf,11,"Here are the notes in advanced bullet-point markdown format:

"What we’ve managed to do so far is work out a proof of concept. This is a very important step, and one that we recommend you always complete before attempting to build a larger model. It may be that the full problem that we want to solve will require a very complex model with many pieces. That model might take days, weeks, or more, to train. How disappointing would it be to invest a month into training a network only to discover when it finishes that the model doesn’t work as expected? Therefore, a better approach is to try to simplify the problem. What are the essentials of the problem you are trying to solve? For this problem, we are trying to locate a character in an image. Rather than trying to solve the whole problem up front, let’s see if we can find just one character in any image. If we cannot do that with the model we have in mind, how can we expect that same model to solve a much more complex problem?

Thus far, we have only created networks that have one output. Certainly, we have solved categorization problems that provide multiple categories and, therefore, multiple output neurons, but what is pictured here is different. What we see here is that following multiple CNN layers, the result is collapsed to a single dense layer. This dense layer then feeds five separate paths. The one on the far left determines the coordinates for all of the bounding boxes. The other four determine which characters are present in each location. How do we bifurcate a model like this to create multiple paths through the model and multiple output layers1? 1As opposed to multiple output neurons, which we already know how to do. 14",Book 6_2036060.pdf,15,"Here are the notes on Tensorflow Functional API:
### Tensorflow Functional API
#### Model Structure
* The model consists of multiple CNN layers followed by a single dense layer
* The dense layer is connected to **five separate paths**:
	+ One path determines the **coordinates for all bounding boxes**
	+ The other four paths determine which **characters are present in each location**
#### Key Concept
* **Multiple output layers** are created by bifurcating the model, as opposed to having multiple output neurons
#### Question
* How to bifurcate a model like this to create **multiple paths through the model and multiple output layers**?"
"Creating this type of network requires the use of the functional API for TensorFlow. You might recall that, when we outlined what we were going to attempt to do in this capstone lab, we said that there was yet another reason we had chosen this problem, but that we were not ready to reveal that reason. We are ready. This is it! As we attempt to solve more complex problems, we will find ourselves needing to create models that have multiple input layers that end up merging somewhere in the model, or multiple different output paths, or perhaps both. We may want to carry the output from some intermediate layer through a primary path and to then reinject the output of that layer again, further down. The functional API allows us to do all of these things. You can see an example of using this functional API in the slide. Notice the flow of it: input_layer = keras.Input(shape=(10,10,3)) model = layers.Conv2D(8, 8, activation='relu')(input_layer) model = layers.MaxPooling2D(2)(model) model = layers.Conv2D(32, 3, activation='relu')(model) ... Rather than using the add() function on a model object to add a layer, we are passing the entire model so far as an argument to a new layer. At first, this might seem backward, since it might initially feel as though the last layer will be evaluated first, but this is backward. The innermost function will be called first, which means that the layers will be called in order. The advantage to building this model in this way is that we can arbitrarily choose to pass some previous layer (or set of layers) in again, or to bifurcate the model and pass the same current layer into multiple different branches. This makes our networks very flexible. 15",Book 6_2036060.pdf,16,"Here are the notes in advanced bullet-point format:

**Creating a Multiple-Input Network with TensorFlow's Functional API**
============================================================

**Why Functional API?**
--------------------

* Required for creating complex models with multiple input layers, merging layers, or multiple output paths
* Enables building flexible networks with arbitrary layers and connections

**Functional API Basics**
-------------------------

* Creates models by passing the entire model as an argument to a new layer
* Layers are called in order, with the innermost function called first
* Advantage: allows for passing previous layers or bifurcating the model into multiple branches

**Example Code**
--------------

* `input_layer = keras.Input(shape=(10,10,3))`
* `model = layers.Conv2D(8, 8, activation='relu')(input_layer)`
* `model = layers.MaxPooling2D(2)(model)`
* `model = layers.Conv2D(32, 3, activation='relu')(model)`

**Key Concepts**
----------------

* **Functional API**: a way of creating TensorFlow models that allows for flexible, complex architectures
* **Multiple input layers**: models can have multiple input layers that merge or split at various points
* **Arbitrary layer connections**: layers can be connected in arbitrary ways, enabling complex network architectures"
"Defining Inputs and Outputs When you build a model in this way, the trickiest thing is properly configuring the inputs and outputs when we define the model. Doing so in the model statement is fairly straightforward. We define inputs andoutputs with the layers that represent the various aspects of the network. The more complicated piece is properly configuring our data or dataset that feeds the network during training. In the exercise that we are working on, we will use a dataset. A dataset is a good general- ization to use since it allows us to work with any kind of data, especially datasets that cannot all be held in memory simultaneously. When using a dataset, the input and output shapes are defined as a tuple. This is the most impor- tant thing to keep in mind. If we lose sight of this needing to produce a tuple that represents the correct shapes, we can spend many hours trying to understand why our training doesn’t work and TensorFlow keeps complaining. Chances are you will have the opportunity to see your instructor wrestle with this very problem. 16",Book 6_2036060.pdf,17,"Here are the notes in advanced bullet-point markdown format:

"What kind of performance can we expect from the model that we develop in the lab? On this slide, we have the TensorBoard output giving us the overall accuracy of the bounding box predictions. By the end of 26 epochs, our accuracy is at or above 99.6%. For a moment, consider what this means. It is easy to look at these numbers and to think, “Well, it’s not perfect.” However, it might be better than you realize at first. The accuracy is measuring how well the network approximated the exact coordinates of the upper- left and lower-right corners of four different bounding boxes. The network is determining 16 com- pletely independent values. When this reports that, over these 16 values the network was 99.6% accurate, it means that rather than finding a coordinate such as (102, 98) , it found a coordinate more like (101.2, 99.4) . In other words, that degree of accuracy for a regression of a continuous value is amazing. 17",Book 6_2036060.pdf,18,"Here are the notes in advanced bullet-point markdown format:

**Model Performance**
=====================

* **Accuracy of Bounding Box Predictions**:
	+ **TensorBoard Output**: Overall accuracy of bounding box predictions
	+ **Endpoint Accuracy**: 99.6% by the end of 26 epochs
* **Implications of Accuracy**:
	+ **Measuring 16 Independent Values**: Network approximates coordinates of 4 bounding boxes (16 values)
	+ **Regression of Continuous Values**: 99.6% accuracy translates to a margin of error of ~0.2-0.4 (e.g., predicted (101.2, 99.4) instead of (102, 98))
	+ **Significance of Accuracy**: This degree of accuracy is remarkable for a regression of continuous values"
"We know that it can figure out where the characters are and identify bounding boxes. How well does it do predicting the characters themselves? Pictured in the slide, we can see TensorBoard’s visualization of the accuracy for each of the individ- ual characters. Curiously, the accuracy decreases as we move from left to right in the CAPTCHA. Why is this? It is difficult to say without significantly more investigation. However, there seems to be a very straightforward way to improve this: More training! Since we are generating each CAPTCHA as training is occurring, we can safely train this for as many epochs as we need to increase the accuracy without fear of overfitting. 18",Book 6_2036060.pdf,19,"Here are the notes on the topic in advanced bullet-point markdown format:

**Character Recognition in CAPTCHA Breaking**

### Accuracy of Character Prediction
* TensorBoard's visualization shows the accuracy of predicting individual characters in a CAPTCHA
* **Accuracy decreases from left to right** in the CAPTCHA, but the reason is unclear without further investigation

### Improving Character Prediction
* **More training** can improve the accuracy of character prediction
* Generating CAPTCHAs during training allows for extended training without overfitting concerns"
"Even with the accuracy for some of the characters ending up at less than 90%, consider how well the network performs. In the slide, we have 25 example predictions of randomly generated CAPTCHAs. You can see that in some cases, the characters overlap; in all cases, the characters are in different positions, sizes, and fonts. In each example, we have drawn bounding boxes around the characters based on the output of the neural network. You can see that the network will frequently trim a few pixels off or add a few extra pixels in. Even so, you can see that the predictions are nearly all correct. Is this performance sufficient for the challenge that we set out? Definitely. We can safely say that this network performs at least as well as a human. While a human might get different CAPTCHAs wrong than this one does, this still performs well enough to use in an automated attack tool against an application protected with this CAPTCHA. Alternatively, as a blue team member, we have demon- strated that defeating this CAPTCHA with a computer really is not difficult at all. 19",Book 6_2036060.pdf,20,"Here are the notes in advanced bullet-point format:

"Thinking Outside of the ML Box We should be proud of this solution. It has drawn together many different techniques and intu- itions to create something truly useful. However, there might be something about it that is a bit shortsighted. The model that we are considering took more than 27 hours to train on a system with dual 2080 GPUs and 256 gigs of RAM. What if we needed to adjust the model to find five characters? Or six characters? What if we needed to add in a new set of fonts? In all of these cases, we would be looking at a significant amount of additional training. This leads us to wonder if there is a better approach to this that might end up being more efficient and more customizable. The answer is, “Yes!” Additionally, this will allow us to consider and demonstrate the concept of transfer learning1. 1Transfer learning is the practice of taking a model previously trained to solve one problem and reusing it to solve another. Rather than training the entire model from scratch, we can mark certain layers as frozen, so their parameters will remain unchanged during the subsequent training. The other layers, and potentially additional layers, will be adjusted during the training process. 21",Book 6_2036060.pdf,22,"Here are the notes in advanced bullet-point format:

"What if we were to view this problem as two separate problems. Problem 1: Build a neural network, likely using CNN layers, that returns predictions for bounding boxes representing the positions of characters in an image of an arbitrary size. Problem 2: Build a neural network that can take an arbitrary rectangle of visual data and identify the single character or symbol present in that image. Joint Solution: What if we fed the output of the bounding box network to the input of the character identifier four times? It’s true that we are no longer solving both of these problems in parallel, but this turns out to have some huge advantages. For example, is it likely that a network that only has to find bounding boxes can be trained much more quickly than a network that finds bounding boxes andthe characters inside of them? Addi- tionally, recall that the third and fourth predictions were of a much lower accuracy than the first and second. Is it likely that we can create a highly specialized network that identifies characters with a very high degree of accuracy, and that we can train that network very quickly? Of Hammers and Nails What we are driving at is a problem that we find in the machine learning, and all other computer science spaces. You have likely heard the expression, “For a man who owns a hammer, every problem looks like a nail.” It is a common failing to take our new tool, in this case neural networks, and try to use them to solve every problem we find.

"to neural networks. This can also lead to us being blinded to simpler techniques that result in the same or a better solution. What we are suggesting with the preceding discussion that breaks this CAPTCHA solver into two networks is a typical programming approach: Divide and conquer1. Rather than building “One model to rule them all,” let’s build smaller, purpose-built models that are specialized. This makes them reusable, almost like reusable gadgets or code snippets. 1The divide and conquer approach is to take a large, seemingly difficult or intractable, problem and to break it into much smaller, tractable problems that can be solved simply. 23",Book 6_2036060.pdf,24,"Here are the notes on the topic of divide and conquer approach in relation to neural networks:

"Optimizing Networks Generalizing and Hyperparameter Tuning It is worth mentioning that the approach we are taking here is very realistic. That is, rather than creating a model that does everything that we want to do in one try, we are building a proof of concept that solves a much smaller version of the problem first. If you think about it, this makes a lot of sense. Training a complex model can take hours, days, weeks, or even months. Might we end up wasting a great deal of time on a more complete solution that turns out not to perform well? Could we better spend our time attempting to solve a simpler form of the problem first? Certainly. Solving the simpler problem first allows us to determine if our hypothesis as to a good approach to solving the problem works at a small scale. It gives us the opportunity to learn lessons about how our data is represented and about potential problem spots in the larger solution. Once we feel that we understand these intricacies well, and we have a model that performs adequately on the small-scale problem, we can scale the solution up to the full problem. Along the way, we are interested in optimizing our solution. We will investigate an approach toward automatic optimization as our final topic in the course, but for now, we’ll adjust things manually. What we are describing is the tuning of hyperparameters. Hyperparameters are all of the things about a model that we can adjust that are outside of the neurons themselves. The weights and biases, for example, are the actual parameters. Those are the values that the machine learning algorithm adjusts. Hyperparameters are the things that we adjust in the design of the model. 26",Book 6_2036060.pdf,27,"Here are the notes on the topic of Optimizing Networks, Generalizing, and Hyperparameter Tuning:

"Hyperparameters would include the number of hidden layers in our model, the number of neurons or the size of the kernels in those layers, the activation functions that are used in those layers, which optimizer is used, the learning rate for the optimizer, etc. When reading literature on machine learning research, you will find that tunable hyperparameters that accept integers will most frequently be set to values that are powers of two. There is no magical reason for this. These choices are completely arbitrary1. The choice of values that are powers of two seems more likely to be rooted in the fact that we are using computers to solve problems, and powers of two are traditional values to use in computer-based solutions. This has led to an interesting situation. In published research, a value that is a power of two will not receive a second glance by a reviewer or critic of the research. However, if the researcher sets the number of neurons to a value that is something other than a power of two, this will almost certainly invite questions and possibly criticism. To the academic community, this implies that setting the number of neurons to 80, for example, is a specific requirement. To the research community, this is taken to indicate that the model does not perform well when some other value is used. To this community, this means that the model does notgeneralize2well. We, however, are far more interested in the practical applications of this work. It is unlikely that we are writing research papers that we will seek to submit to ArXiv3or some other research institution or journal. We are interested in creating models that work in the real world and solve specific problems. Since we are interested in solutions that work, we would suggest to you that well-tuned models, regardless of how the research community might view them, are what matter in the real world. 1There are some opinions that using values that are powers of two optimizes how our memory is used in the system, possibly making our entire solution more efficient. We have seen no proof that this is the case. Further, if this were true, you would need to optimize not only the values in a single layer, but all of the layers in aggregate to truly benefit from such a theoretical optimization. 2By generalize here, we mean that the model presented as a solution to the particular machine learning problem might work particularly well in this specific case, but it would probably not work well for other related problems. 3ArXiv is a well-known, open-access, research publications repository run by Cornell University.

"Building a proof of concept and tuning it to understand the problem can be challenging and frus- trating. For example, here we have some TensorBoard output depicting our attempts to compare different numbers of filters in a CNN using embedding layers, seeking to find a set of parameters that performs well. In the example pictured, we performed a brute force search using between 40 and 90 kernels in the CNN with 20 embedding dimensions and then examined the loss over each epoch for four epochs. While most of these models have rapidly decreasing losses over the first and even the second epoch, the majority flatten out. Notice that the model with the lowest loss overall after five epochs is a model that starts with among the highest loss in the first epoch. This type of experimentation can help us to find hyperparameters that work well for our specific problem. Why do the settings for that particular model work well? Sometimes, our intuition and experience lead us to select values that work extremely well. Sometimes, we don’t have a good idea of which values will work well. In these cases, we don’t know what will work, so we experiment. When the experiment is successful, we then stand back and try to understand whythose values work well.

"Here we can see the same models, but we are now visualizing accuracy over five epochs. None of these models perform especially well yet. Still, this experimentation over a limited number of epochs allows us to see that the model that had the lowest loss1also produces the highest accuracy. The trajectory of the accuracy also looks very promising. Would it be worth training this model for, perhaps, one or two hundred epochs to see how well it performs in the end? Probably! 1And a loss, if you will recall, that was continuing to decrease more rapidly than any of the other models. 29",Book 6_2036060.pdf,30,"**Model Performance Over Five Epochs**

"When we begin to train models for dozens or hundreds of epochs, we need to be much more con- cerned about overfitting. Recall that overfitting would mean that our model is becoming very good at classifying the training data set but might not perform nearly as well in the real world. When we want to train for a high number of epochs, we need to have an enormous amount of data. In our CAPTCHA example, this is simple to solve; we are generating a new set of CAPTCHAs throughout the entire training process. Really, this is about the most ideal situation that we could hope for. While we are still viewing this as a series of training epochs, every epoch in the training data is completely different. Using a generator that produces new samples every time has another benefit. We can forgo a vali- dation split or validation data set. Remember that the purpose of the validation data is to help us to identify and limit the effects of overfitting. Since the training data is constantly changing, we have no fear of memorizing that training data in our network. Still, there are other techniques that we use to limit overfitting when using a more limited set of training data. These techniques may at first seem counterintuitive since they have the effect of slowing down training. In other words, when we add in something like a Dropout layer, our accuracy and loss will initially be worse. However, when we train for more epochs, the overall accuracy and loss should be greatly improved. ADropout layer isn’t really a layer in the same sense as our other layers. Dropout layers do not add neurons to our model. Instead, a Dropout layer allows us to define a percentage. In a sense, the layer acts as a filter between two layers. Consider the following model: model = Sequential() model.add(Input(input_shape=32)) model.add(Dense(100, activation=""tanh"")) 30",Book 6_2036060.pdf,31,"Here are the notes in advanced bullet-point markdown format:

"model.add(Dropout(0.4)) model.add(Dense(256, activation=""tanh"")) model.add(Dropout(0.4)) model.add(Dense(10, activation=""softmax"")) In this model, we have included two Dropout layers. When the outputs of the first dense layer are passed as inputs to the second dense layer, the dropout layer indicates that some random 40% of those neurons will be passed through as eros. In other words, their values have been dropped out. This behavior is only applied during training. Also, take note that which neurons are dropped out is random, so it changes in every pass through the network. How is this helpful? Dropping out neurons serves to force the model to generalize since some of the “paths” through the network aren’t available randomly. The theory is that this prevents the model from memorizing the training data, thus improving overall generalization. 31",Book 6_2036060.pdf,32,"Here are the notes on the topic of Dropout layers in Neural Networks:

* **Forces the model to generalize** since some of the ""paths"" through the network aren't available randomly
* **Prevents the model from memorizing the training data**, thus improving overall **generalization**"
"Pooling Layers Another approach toward modifying how our model generalizes and achieving something similar to Dropout is the use of Pooling layers. Pooling layers are used with two or more dimensional data with CNN layers. A pooling layer aggregates the values from one layer into another layer. Let’s consider an example using average pooling on a 6 × 6 matrix of values with a 2 × 2 average pooling. ⎡ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎣0 1 2 3 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0⎤ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎦⟶⎡ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎣0.75 1.25 1.75 1.75 1.25 0.5 0.5 0.5 0.5 0.5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0.5 0.5 0 0 0.25 0.75 0.5 0 0⎤ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎦ Notice that each of the output values represents the average of the 2 × 2 set of values. Max pooling is very similar, but rather than averaging the values, the cell is set to whichever input has the highest value. When applying pooling, notice that the overall dimensions of the output decrease. This size change can be computed in the same way that a valid convolution changes the dimensions. Additionally, pooling can be applied using a stride. Pooling serves to reduce the overall number of parameters, but it also tends to smooth out noise. It can also be viewed as highlighting or emphasizing prominent features while removing less promi- nent features. 32",Book 6_2036060.pdf,33,"Here are the notes on Pooling Layers in advanced markdown format:

**Pooling Layers**
================

**What are Pooling Layers?**
-------------------------

* A type of layer used in conjunction with **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**
* Aggregate values from one layer into another layer

**How do Pooling Layers work?**
-----------------------------

* **Average Pooling**: takes the average value of a set of values
	+ Example: 2x2 average pooling on a 6x6 matrix
		- Output values represent the average of the 2x2 set of values
* **Max Pooling**: sets the output value to the highest input value
	+ Similar to average pooling, but takes the maximum value instead of the average

**Effects of Pooling Layers**
---------------------------

* **Reduce the number of parameters**
* **Smooth out noise**
* **Highlight prominent features** while removing less prominent ones
* **Decrease output dimensions**, which can be computed similarly to a valid convolution

**Applying Pooling Layers**
-------------------------

* Can be applied with a **stride**, similar to convolutional layers

"Custom Loss Functions You may, at times, seek to build a model for something where the readily available loss functions don’t work particularly well for your problem. For example, while mean squared error is available, you might find that, for some problems, this number grows too large. What if you want to apply this type of loss, but you need the value to be scaled smaller? One solution would be to use the root mean squared error, which is just the square root of the mean squared error. The advantage is that, if your model initial has enormous loss values, this will bring those numbers down to something more reasonable when training starts out. Implementing a custom loss function is very straightforward in TensorFlow. The Keras library provides the Loss class, which you can extend. While there are a number of different things that you can define, you must define the __init__() method and the call() method. When creating a custom loss function it is very important to use the TensorFlow math operations rather than those provided by NumPy or Python. The reason is connected to how neural network learning works. We understand that the algorithm will pass the input data through the network attempting to match the correct outputs. We also know that the weights and biases1are adjusted up and down in an effort to minimize the loss. But how does the algorithm know how to adjust these values? The answer is connected to what is called backpropagation. Backpropagation occurs after a batch of data has been mapped and the error has been calculated for that batch. The next step is to work backward to determine how each weight and bias value influenced the overall result and to make small adjustments to them as needed to reduce the loss. 1Or the values within the kernels for a CNN. 33",Book 6_2036060.pdf,34,"**Custom Loss Functions**
=====================

### Motivation
* Need for custom loss functions when available ones don't work well for a specific problem
* Example: mean squared error grows too large, need to scale down values

### Solution: Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
* **RMSE**: square root of mean squared error
* Advantage: brings down enormous loss values to reasonable numbers when training starts

### Implementing Custom Loss Functions in TensorFlow
* Use the **Loss** class from the Keras library and extend it
* Must define **__init__()** and **call()** methods
* **Important**: use TensorFlow math operations, not NumPy or Python operations
	+ Reason: connected to neural network learning and backpropagation

### Backpropagation
* Occurs after a batch of data is mapped and error is calculated
* Works backward to determine how each weight and bias influenced the result
* Makes small adjustments to weights and biases to reduce the loss"
"The matter of determining how each weight and bias affects the output requires that we determine the gradient of the error function for each neuron and for each weight and bias relative to all of the other previous layers that influenced that neuron. This requires that we work out the solution to a differential equation. The approach taken is known as a partial differential. We are not going to go through all of the mathematics of this, but we can explain it somewhat simply. If we have some equation 𝑓 (𝑥) = 2𝑥2− 𝑥 + 3 , we can use the power rule to quickly determine that the derivative of this function is: 𝑓′(𝑥) = (4𝑥 − 1)𝑑𝑦 𝑑𝑥 In this resulting function,𝑑𝑦 𝑑𝑥indicates that this function represents the change in 𝑦relative to the change in 𝑥. This is very straightforward. We use the following function to represent the cross-entropy loss of the output: 𝐶 = −(𝑦 log ̂ 𝑦 + (1 − 𝑦) log (1 − ̂ 𝑦)) Now that we have the value for 𝐶, our loss, we need to determine its relationship to the weights and biases in the network. The updates of these values are calculated by adjusting them, as needed, relative to a value 𝛼, which is our learning rate1. Since we are attempting to figure out how the loss changes relative to the weights and to simultane- ously determine how the loss changes relative to the biases, we are attempting to take a derivative of a function with two unknowns. We cannot do this directly, which is what leads us to the idea of apartial differential. 𝑤𝑖= 𝑤𝑖− 𝛼𝛿𝐶 𝛿𝑤𝑖𝑏𝑖= 𝑏𝑖− 𝛼𝛿𝐶 𝛿𝑏𝑖 Notice that, rather than using𝑑𝑦 𝑑𝑥, we are instead using𝛿𝑦 𝛿𝑥. This squiggly looking character is the lowercase Greek letter delta. How is this different from the normal𝑑𝑦 𝑑𝑥? Partial differentials can initially seem daunting. However, it turns out that they really aren’t so difficult once you understand what a derivative is and how to calculate it. In a partial differential, you hold all but one independent value constant while calculating the derivative relative to the dependent value of interest. Since we are looking to calculate the change in the biases and the weights, two partial differentials are taken, one relative to each of these values. At this point, you might not remember what we were talking about that brought us to this point. We stated that you must use the TensorFlow variants of the numeric functions. Why is this? 1The learning rate is simply a small value used to govern the size of adjustments after each batch and epoch. 34",Book 6_2036060.pdf,35,"**Determining Weight and Bias Effects on Output: Gradient Descent**
============================================================

### **Partial Derivatives and Gradient Descent**

* **Goal:** Determine how each weight and bias affects the output by computing the gradient of the error function.
* **Method:** Partial differentials (PDs) are used to calculate the derivative of the loss function with respect to each weight and bias.

### **Simple Example: Power Rule and Derivatives**

* **Example function:** 𝑓(𝑥) = 2𝑥² - 𝑥 + 3
* **Derivative:** 𝑓′(𝑥) = (4𝑥 - 1) using the power rule
* **Notation:** 𝑑𝑦/𝑑𝑥 indicates the change in 𝑦 with respect to the change in 𝑥

### **Cross-Entropy Loss Function**

* **Loss function:** 𝐶 = -(𝑦 log ̂ 𝑦 + (1 - 𝑦) log (1 - ̂ 𝑦))
* **Goal:** Minimize the loss function by adjusting weights and biases

### **Updating Weights and Biases**

* **Updates:** 𝑤𝑖 = 𝑤𝑖 - 𝛼𝛿𝐶/𝛿𝑤𝑖 and 𝑏𝑖 = 𝑏𝑖 - 𝛼𝛿𝐶/𝛿𝑏𝑖
* **Learning rate:** 𝛼 governs the size of adjustments after each batch and epoch

### **Partial Differentials**

* **Notation:** 𝛿𝑦/𝛿𝑥 (lowercase Greek letter delta) is used instead of 𝑑𝑦/𝑑𝑥
* **Definition:** In a partial differential, all but one independent value is held constant while calculating the derivative relative to the dependent value of interest.

Note: This summary focuses on the key concepts and formulas related to partial derivatives and gradient descent."
"While there are algorithms for calculating arbitrary derivatives and differentials, these can be slow and complex. TensorFlow takes an interesting shortcut. Rather than having to calculate the deriva- tives from scratch, it records all of the numeric operations that occur in a batch on a gradient tape. In other words, it knows every operation that was taken and the order it was taken in. This allows TensorFlow to take a shortcut in unwinding the operations and determining the partial derivatives quickly and easily! 35",Book 6_2036060.pdf,36,"**Derivative Calculation in TensorFlow**

"We pointed out previously that a brute force search of the hyperparameter space for our model is seemingly impossible. There are just far too many possibilities. As an alternative to this, we can take a more directed strategy. The approach that we prefer is a Genetic Search Algorithm. Take note that this really isn’t a machine learning topic, per se. Rather, this is an optimization problem. However, this technique is especially useful when it comes to optimizing neural networks. The goal is to narrow our search to only the most promising models in the vast sea of possible models. Our goal is to find highly accurate models that converge relatively quickly. 37",Book 6_2036060.pdf,38,"**Optimizing Hyperparameter Space using Genetic Search Algorithm**

"For our lab, we aren’t going to try to solve a very difficult problem with our genetic algorithm. This isn’t because this isn’t a viable approach; this is all about timing. We want to attempt to optimize a problem that we can solve in the time remaining in our class. We will build a tool that we can generalize to use for any kind of neural network that we might build. If you think about the IMDB classification problem that we started our discussion of neural networks with, there is a huge search space for possible configuration. For example: •What if we bounded the network as having between 1 and 10 layers? •What if each hidden layer could have between 10 and 500 neurons? •Should some of the initial layers be CNNs? •What kernel size should be used? •What stride should be used? •How many CNNs work best? •Which activation functions should be used in each layer? •Which optimization function performs best? There are many moving parts to this problem. If you think about this as a brute force approach, just as we might approach password guessing, we would have to try every possible combination, train each model for some number of epochs, and then measure the performance of each possible network against all others. Whichever performs best is “right.” Even if we narrowed our possibilities to just using between 1 and 10 dense layers with between 10 and 500 neurons each, we have well over 1.953 × 1032possibilities to test. If each network took only 1 second per epoch to train and we trained each for 5 epochs, this works out to being more than 3.09 × 1025years! Clearly, we do not have that kind of time. 38",Book 6_2036060.pdf,39,"**Genetic Algorithm for Neural Network Optimization**

"General Approach This brings us to the genetic approach. While we will start with a random population of possible networks, we will cross-breed these networks and evolve them over time. The general algorithm is as follows: 1.Generate enough models to have a generation of size 𝑛. 2.Train each model 3.Compare the accuracy and loss of each to all other models in the generation 4.Keep the best 𝑚models (and remember long-term the best performing overall) 5.Breed each of these 𝑚models with each of the other 𝑚models to generate hybrid offspring 6.Randomly mutate each of these 𝑚models 7.Repeat from step 1 𝑥times. 39",Book 6_2036060.pdf,40,"Here are the notes on the genetic approach in advanced bullet-point format:

**Genetic Approach**
=====================

* **Overview**: Evolve neural networks over time by cross-breeding and mutating them.
* **Algorithm**:
	+ **Step 1**: Generate **𝑛** models to create a generation.
	+ **Step 2**: Train each model.
	+ **Step 3**: Compare accuracy and loss of each model to all other models.
	+ **Step 4**: Keep the best **𝑚** models and remember the best performing overall.

	+ **Step 6**: Randomly mutate each of the **𝑚** models.
	+ **Step 7**: Repeat from Step 1 **𝑥** times.

**Key Concepts**:
* **Generation**: A population of neural networks.
* **Breeding**: Combining models to generate hybrid offspring.
* **Mutation**: Randomly changing model parameters.

Let me know if you'd like me to help with anything else!"
"The genetic part of this process is the mutation and the breeding. The random models are simple. Mutating models should involve some random adjustments to a well-performing model. The idea is that if a particular model did well, does adjusting slightly the number of neurons, or the number of layers, or the activation, or some other aspect, improve the model? This doesn’t mean that we are generating another completely random model. In other words, we are not changing everything in the model. Instead, some aspects are being held stable and others are being mutated. Perhaps our search algorithm will generate five mutations, each of which mutates a different aspect of the well-performing model. Breeding the models means that we are taking some aspects of each of the parent models and com- bining them to generate offspring. Again, as with mutations, we don’t want to create only one child. Instead, we should create several children, mixing the different attributes of the original models just as genes are mixed when DNA merges and an embryo is formed. We would like to be sure that each generation is large enough for our algorithm to also inject some number of completely random models. Why? When using genetic algorithms, you will often find that your models are generally and steadily improving generation over generation. It is unusual for a mutation or a child to suddenly and dra- matically improve in performance over its ancestors, though it can happen. However, including completely random algorithms allows for chance well-performing networks to add their genetic material to the process. Frequently, huge jumps in performance originate with these randomly in- troduced models. 40",Book 6_2036060.pdf,41,"Here are the notes on the topic of genetic algorithms in machine learning:

* **Random models can lead to significant performance jumps**"
"This brings us to our final project. We aren’t considering this our capstone since this project is more of a support tool for working with neural networks rather than building the network itself. There are a few existing libraries and tools that can help you to perform searches of neural networks. Most of these are designed around a grid search. These are not the same, but can perform well. Rather than taking our approach, they tune hyperparameters much as we tune the weights and biases, working out which “direction” to move the model in order to improve overall performance. The tool we will build specializes in genetic search. We are not aware of any generally available tool that implements this for neural networks. Even if such a tool existed, there is tremendous value in building our own. By doing so, we are building a tool that we can use for anyproblem we face in the future. And if our tool needs some adjustment or needs to support some new kind of neural network layer, adding support is no problem for us since we wrote the tool. 41",Book 6_2036060.pdf,42,"Here are the notes in advanced bullet-point markdown format:

"Concluding Thoughts We sincerely hope that you have enjoyed this course. As promised at the outset, we have not made you data scientists. However, we very much hope that we have made you someone who is far more data conscious than you were at the outset. You should be leaving this class with a much deeper understanding of statistics, probability, and machine learning. More than this, you should have formed an intuitive understanding of when and how each can be employed. You should also now see how these different approaches are intercon- nected, allowing you to transition from one to another, or to use one to simplify an approach to another. Perhaps the biggest thing that we hope that you are leaving class with is an understanding of how to use these machine learning tools to build your own machine learning solutions and how to take your problems and translate them into something that can be solved using a machine learning tool. By far, this is the biggest hurdle that people within the information security space face. Along the way, we have emphasized some of the mathematical notations and tried to familiarize you with it. Our goal was never to make you a mathematician. Our goal, and we hope that you will agree that this is true, was to make these math expressions seem far less esoteric. We sincerely hope that you can look back on these various formulas and recognize them rather than need to memorize them. We hope that you can, at least at a rudimentary level, read these formulas. We spent time doing this because we want you to be able to continue to expand your knowledge in this field. Doing so will require reading the current research as it evolves, and this research is almost always written using this type of notation.
